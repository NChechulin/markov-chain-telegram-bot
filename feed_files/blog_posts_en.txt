I spent the night with Austin last night and I had a pretty good time, but let me give you a little background info
I talked to Al yesterday morning, and I kind of invited him over
As you know I went to Austin's, yeah I know big trouble
Anyways, Austin called and asked me if I wanted to spend the night, I kind of wanted to, sense he stays here a week then at his dad's for two
Then I called Al and said if he cared if I went over to Austin's
He got mad! I said he could come over if he wanted to and I tried to be nice, but he gets mad and hangs up
So I go to Austin's house
Now for today, I woke up at Austin's and my sister called and asked if I wanted to go on the boat with her and her friends
I went and had lots of fun
First we tried knee boarding, I hate it so
I tried five times and ended up just drinking lots of lake water
We tubed which is always fun, but Matt, Kat's friend, drove too fast
It scared me! He ended up going slower and I had a good time
So everyone just needs to hope that Al is happy with me again
To my son Tristan,    Although you have yet to be born, I wanted to begin this webblog for you to give you an outline of what has happened thus far since your conception
Currently you are living a warm comfortable life inside your mother's womb having been in existence for only 18 weeks and 5 days
You are expected to make your arrival in this world on October 15th of 2004, but only when the time comes will the date be determined
My love for you is growing with leaps and bounds
We have seen you twice, so far
Once about 6 weeks ago when you were only 12 weeks, and then again just last week when you were 18 weeks and 1 day
You are quite the mover!  It was very exciting to see you twisting and moving as the nurse passed the ultrasound device around your mother's stomach
Tristan, your mother and I have such high hopes for you
We have grand plans for you to learn so much about life and love
Your grandfather (on your mother's side) is giddy with the prospect of teaching you of his experiences with martial arts and such
You have much to learn of computers from me, and mathematics from your mother
My mother can teach of you of art and kindness while my father can teach you of literature and business
Your grandmother (on your mother's side) can teach you of compassion and an eye for color
Your mother and I are already so proud of you and love you so very much
She tells me constantly of your movements inside of her and I am so excited at the prospect of feeling your kicks and turns as time progresses
I am so looking forward to talking with you within the womb and as a newborn in only a few months' time
I love you my son, we will meet soon
Ariston Collander Father to Tristan Stewart Collander Expected: October 15th, 2004

Hey peoples
This morning were the lovely SAT II's
Thank god they are over for the summer
I don't want school work for at least another two weeks
Alanna was there this morning taking the SAT I, so I got to see her and hang out for about ten minutes and sing about ice cream men
And a surprising number of familiar faces were there also: besides lovely lanna, I saw laylee, brock, elise, LA, lauren, dan ying, etc
Fun faces, I say
I needed that boost
New meds probably start tomorrow morning
The fucking pills are huge, so let's hope they are worth it
Alanna, Amber, Heather, I may be out for a week or so, because the stuff causes, apparently, spontaneous dizziness and drowsiness
Not that I am already free of dizziness already
And I apologize if I am hostile to anyone in the next week; the meds can cause hostility to an extent for a little while
Not hungry right now, while everyone is eating my recipe of shrimp/chicken pasta
I am usually ravenous
I dunno
I want to see someone right now
Like Alanna
Let's do something Alanna
Cheers
currently listening to: REO Speedwagon - I Can't Fight This Feeling Anymore  hahahahaha
man i'm so lame, why am i listening to REO Speedwagon
i do wish i had a cool shirt like Billy Madison though to wear with a cool denim jacket
so last week i was contacted by 4 different people through friendster that i had lost touch with
it's been like 5-7 years since i last saw any of them
we were really good friends back then too, but we never went to the same school, or lived in a close proximity, so it just fizzled i guess
so thanks to friendster i am talking to all of them again, which is very cool
weird how things work out isn't it?  and so life goes on
darth please don't comment about the show life goes on, it was not a cool, but it makes me smile
hahaha
oh yeah i saw lost in translation yesterday
bill murray is sweet, his humor is pure genius
currently listening to: Saves The Day - Sell My Old Clothes, I'm Off to Heaven
That was me that said that, not Mungo
Apparently the new style has made it difficult for ST to comprehend who is writing what
Flights with 2 year olds are fun and exciting
If all else fails, drug them
Trust me, this can be a good thing
We are now in Beijing, at The Penninsula Palace Hotel, and Alex and I are in room 666
Seriously
I'm not kidding
Not only that, but mom and dad are next door, which I generally hate as I'd prefer the annonymity of being on a different floor, but their room isn't even ready yet
At 4 fucking pm
Thus, we're all crammed in room 666 exhausted, cranky, and dreaming of The St
I had to get out
So I came to The Business Center
At least I know when to separate myself
Everyone is driving me nuts
My mother referred to John Mak-lo-vitch and I was ready to stab her with my complimentary pen
My father, assuming all things are foriegn and different in China, couldn't figure out how to twist the top off a bottle of Evian
Literally
I'm ready to kill these idiots that created me
Yes, yes, I know they're wonderful parents who, as my grandmother puts it, whisk me all over the world
But this is the part of family vacations I dread
I'm 26
Having dinner at my parent's house requires that I bite my tounge every 15 minutes
We're on Day 6 of being stuck with each other, it's hot as a mother-fucker, and the sound of my family's voices is making my ears bleed
I keep listening to my CD player spinning 'Shut up' by The Black Eyed Peas, just watching their lips move
We took off from Shanghai in a typhoon, and of course, it's pouring rain in Beijing
It was so hot and humid on the fucking 1970's East China Airlines plane that you coulda steamed rice
Annie, our scantilly clad guide here, informed us to have a big breakfast as we're walking everywhere tomorrow, about 7 miles, and we won't get back to the hotel till, like 6
Thus far, our schedule has been doing our own thing in the moring (my thing being shopping) and then returning to the hotel in the early afternoon for spa treatments or similar
8:30-6 hiking all over town with the broken english bombshell is not what I had in mind
This is what it's like travelling with me
I'm in such a shitty mood, I'm ready to kill the Mid-western idiot at the compter next to me
My god, who are these people? I get that this is an incredible experience, that I'm seeing things most people never have the opportunity to see
But think of all the places you want to go, then imagine going there with both of your parents
It gets hard
Really hard
And suddenly, your mother says Maklovitch and you're ready to fly home
Fucking Maklovitch
Are you kidding me?  My CD player has become my therapy
I block everyone out with my constant replaying of the same songs
Every trip, I bring a million CD's, but only end up listening to 3 of them, obsessed with hearing the same thing over and over
I can't explain it
This trip, it's the entire Scissor Sisters CD, minus the last song, The Last Emperor Soundtrack, and Gavin DeGraw singing a cover of 'Against All Odds' which breaks my heart everytime I hear it
The only thing that has the ability to put me in an instant good mood is 'Filthy/Gorgeous' by The Scissor Sisters, as I've envisioned an entire video starring me, which I performed for Alex last night
It involves me crushing martini glasses with my fabulous Manolo's on the bar at The Redwood Room
I just called Alex up in the room, who informed me that it's safe to come up
The folks have now moved next door, to room 668
As he's saying this, however, I hear in the background, 'Hey Alex, how do you work the lights?'  Ahhhhhhhhhhh!
We were discussing chapters 31 through 33 of 2 Nephi today
One thing bugged me that always bugs me
It seems to be a popular belief that we are baptised to receive a remission of our sins, or more specifically baptism washes our sins away
The problem with this conception is that it minimises the role repentance plays in the conversion process
Remission of sins is not granted through baptism alone or solely on the merits of baptism
Remission of sins comes as a result of our commitment to Jesus, just as it does after baptism
For our sins to be remitted we first need to exercise faith in the Saviour
We need to exercise faith that He lives, He loves us, He overcame the effects of physical and spiritual death and that his life is an ideal pattern for us to follow
urlLink Amulek taught  that following our faith will eventually lead us to repent
As our faith in Jesus grows our desire to be more like Him grows also
This in turn will convince us to both feel sorrow for and forsake our sins
This is done through repentance
Following the forgiveness of our sins and commitment to be like Him, we feel a desire to express our commitment
We do so through baptism
Baptism serves as the manifestation of the covenant we make with Our Brother to follow Him
Following baptism, we are baptised by fire and the Holy Ghost, which subsequently  urlLink sanctifies us
You see, remission of sins comes as a result of a process
We need to have faith in Jesus, repent of our sins, be baptised and receive the Holy Spirit
I honestly fail how leaving out the other three (whether literally or intellectually) can honestly give us a remission of sins

urlLink Click here   for lyrics Im not finished with this site but yea its just a bunch of lyrics and stuff
Starting the winter I was 3, Daddy and I went skiing every Thursday of ski season
He scheduled his classes so he had the day off, and I got to play hookie from school
I don't even remember learning how to ski, I know I had to have learned, it isn't the sort of skill that comes naturally, but I guess I was just too young to remember
(probably a good thing, as I'm not terribly fond of falling down)   If you're going to go skiing weekdays are the time to go, no waiting in line, and if it's snowed lately, often there is still powder on the ground
On the weekends the slopes get packed down due to high traffic, you can get going a little faster, but you don't have the same kind of control, and it hurts more if you fall
It's been years since I've been skiing, we stopped our weekly trips when I started college, and I couldn't get away with skipping school anymore  (we also took a year off when Daddy had his first batch of heart attacks) the last time I went was with my church youth group when I was 13, but if I close my eyes real tight and imagine it, even standing here in my too-warm workplace (the air conditioner on my side of the building is broken, grrrr) I can still feel it
The cold wind biting my face, the way my stomach would do a little flip-flop when I'd go over a jump, the rush of adrenaline when I got going too fast, and I knew I couldn't stop if my life depended on it
Heck, even falling could be a rush if it was a good one, the kind where you roll end over end and then have to spend 15 minutes getting all your stuff back together, because your skis, poles, sunglasses, and hat are scattered every which way
We started taking my step-brothers with us when I was about 10, and it was one of the few times when I didn't resent having them around
You see, I was better at it then them
I know that sounds awful, but it's true, I could and did ski circles around them, and it drove them crazy
They were always a lot bigger than me, Matthew was 2 years older than me, Jesse 8 days younger (a fact I never let him forget) these days Matt is 6'2, Jesse 6'3 and both of them are well over 200 lbs, back then they weren't quite that big, but still just as physically intimidating to yours truly, and they didn't like me any more than I liked them
The good news is I can take a punch
But put us on a mountain and I had the advantage
I was faster, more agile, and by the time they started coming along I thought I was pretty much invincible on a pair of skis
I continually tried to get them killed, and they fell for it every time
(pun intended)  I knew the paths between the slopes that had all the jumps, as well as all the trees (not a good combination) and I'd lead them to certain death by telling them they shouldn't follow me, they could get hurt
I was right
Matthew broke his arm twice, and his leg once, Jesse never broke anything, but had his fair share of sprains, and one concussion (I felt pretty bad about that one) I never got hurt skiing
In hindsight I probably would've gotten beat up a lot less off the mountain, if I hadn't baited them so much on it, but I think it was worth it
This is extraordinarily angry
Makes me want to go out and buy a great pair of heels
Then given them to Mister 'FUCK THEM ALL'
Maybe it'll make him feel better

Well, looks like my mini-vacation has finally come to an end
I had so much fun these past 5 days
From my graduation, to going to the beach, to buying a new car, it was the best couple of days I've spent in a very, very long time
So it should be normal that I think today officially sucks!  The day after my graduation, I went to the beach with my brother, his wife and my girlfriend
We went to a beach so secluded that we were there for more than 5 hours and no one else appeared! It rocked having a beach all to ourselves
That beach is next to a summer house that I went to when I was in high school
The parents of a schoolmate rented the house for the weekend, and I spent an entire day there
It was probably one of the best days in my high school life
So going there again brought back some good memories
I don't have too many good memories, but whenever they come back, it's fun to remember those times!  I also got a new car! A Toyota Corolla 2004, to be precise
I needed a ride, because I was using my mom's car to get here to work, while she was using my sister's car
That was five months ago, so I had to do something! I didn't have any credit at all, which meant being rejected by every car dealer in my area
I checked the last one out, before going in and settling for an older car
That dealer treated me very nice, mostly because a sale for them would mean $$$ in commisions! They checked out my credit, and gave me a chance
So now I have a new toy!  It was a great week, hopefully I'll have another week soon as good as this one
One can only hope for it
Hope everyone's having a great day
See you all later!
life's a bore

anyway, i feel sick, if andrew got me sick i'm gonna kill him lol
i'm going to lay down now
song of the moment: ghost of a good thing ~dashboard confessional
Standing Stone was okay, but Triennium would have been better
I keep forgetting I'm the weird one
Mostly walking to and from the dam, to and from the rec hall, and playing cards, or video games when my cousins ditched me from time to time
It wasn't in a mean way, they just never made an effort to find me before they went and did stuff, and when I found them later in the day, they're all 'Where've you been?' In my freaking cabin, if you cared to look
sheesh
oh well
Some are coming to Jekyll and Hyde
Haha, tricked you, I'm a hippie
So how is everyones Easter holiday? Lots of chocies??  As for me, Easter could not come any sooner =) I finally had some chocolate, about 40 days of chocolate fasting
I know I am now catholic, but my wife is, and since she is giving up dairy for lent, I thought I would join her too
Man was that a big mistake
It is amazing how hard it is to stop something as Chocolate
And where do you draw the line? Can you Oreos cookies? Dring Milo? Chocolate milk etc
Something I have to argue with my conscience, Milo is not chocolate !!
=P I love my Milo
I have been drinking Milo every morning since as along as I can remember
It is my daily source of energy =P  Anyway I am glad the fasting is over
I can finally taste the beautiful food of the gods
So why the silence? Well I have been away
Not away away, I just took a week off during the easter holiday to help my dad in his shop
My parents decided to go on a holiday during Easter, so they needed someone to look after the shop
So guess who had to take Annual leave, to work at the shop
Added to the insult, the whole week, the shop was quite, everyone was on holiday
I am stuck there with the only entertainment is reading my novel
Well atleast I finally finish my book
Anyway if you want to read a freaky book, with a whole lots of twist, then I trully recommend Invisible Monsters by Chuck Palahniuk (He is the author of Fight Club)
If you have seen or read Fight Club, you would know what kind of genre the book is
Let me tell you, after reading this book, I would never look at a female stranger the same way again
I may be getting a complex
No one ever ever replies when I email them or comment in their blogs
If anyone ever commented on mine, and when people write to me about  urlLink womenwriters , I always write back (unless they're asking for something really really annoying-- like me to do major amounts of research for them cause they're too lazy to go to the library)
But nice notes, yeah, I always write back, almost immediately!    So, me feels very sad
Like the last kid picked for the blogger team
'Uh, yeah, you take the kid who can't type cause she's got no thumbs to hit the space bar with, and, darn, that leaves Kim
Allright
We'll take her
::heavy sigh:: but we get to pick first next time!'     Also, women writers is DOWN right now
Pisses me off, that
They better friggin fix it soon
GRR!  But on the good news side-- this last day of classes is HALF OVER!!! Party party!  I'm thinking about margaritas
I like  urlLink LGF
I don't like  urlLink Greatest Jeneration  that much
I think this is partly an age thing and partly that i just dislike her writing  style
Charles is the quietly enraged guy, not particularly prone to exclamation points and clever twists of people's names
Jen reminds me of someone who is gripped with righteous outrage
Charles is closer to my age
Jen is closer to my mothers age
I see the same  types  of comments in both comments sections, though
I also like  urlLink  Wil   a lot
What i find disappointing though is that amongst the 'unwashed masses', so many people find the other sides view to be SOOOO morally repulsive that they simply cannot abide a mere conversation with them
I haven't actually seen this happen IRL, yet
And its not just  pieces  of their view, but the whole thing
I find i agree with and disagree with each side on a lot of issues
I can't call myself one or the other, because neither of them fits me
I'm so confused
But there's this whole delinking thing happening, and thats actually what i set out to write about
I think it's kinda funny
Carnival of the Vanities, indeed!
It rained today
Rain makes me depressed
When i'm depressed, i forget things
Anyways i was pretty lazy today, nothin new
I think i have way too much to do tomorrow
Still, i want saturday to come
or sunday or monday
Then i'll be closer to her
But anyways life goes on with its twisted time clock
Me, i'm justa poor guy caught up in life
I cannot wait to see “Fahrenheit 9/11
”  It’s the latest documentary from Michael Moore and it got a 20-minute standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival
Not surprising since the screening was in France and it really tears into the policies of the Bush Administration
It includes a rarely seen 7-minute clip of Bush being informed that the second tower was struck, and then sitting in a kindergarten chair with a vacant, baffled look on his face
It also shows war atrocities in Iraq with many of our own soldiers questioning what we’re doing
Plans are for the film to be released in theaters this summer (provided that they find a distribution company) and then on video and DVD in the fall
Hopefully it will be seen by many voters as a wake-up call
Sad to say that Tony Randall of “Odd Couple” fame passed away this morning
I met Randall in November, 1999 at the Marriot Marquis Hotel in NYC
I was working with then-Parks Commissioner Henry Stern at a banquet in honor of City College
Stern and Randall were both guest speakers and I had the pleasure of an introduction
I wonder if Nick at Nite or TV Land will show an “Odd Couple” marathon in his honor
Vassar College’s 5-Year reunion for the Class of ’99 is coming up!  June 4, 5, 6
If you haven’t registered,  urlLink do so now at the AAVC home page!
yO MY pEEPS!  So happy 5th!! Arent you excited to celebrate the day after the 4th
If yoou think about it
when america became independant i bet it was a lot more exciting on the 5th than it was on the 4th
because lets face it
everyone was probably REALLY tired on the 4th from all the fighting and such, so it probably felt good for them to get some rest
And i mean, IT DID take a  long  time to finally cut free from the brits, so I bet all the celebrating really happened on the next day
My point is that we should do fireworks, get wasted and get off of work on the 5th instead because that is probably how IT REALLY HAPPENED
Im just bein realistic here
Besides my theory, not much is goin on
Im dissapointed that i havent looked at the blog ONCE since i last posted and nothing has happened
no comments, no posts and no tag board sexual harassment from jimmy
Its upsetting
a miracle ocurred last night at approximately 7:50 pm
WE GOT INTO THE DRAFTHOUSE
NO problems whatsoever
Unfortunately Betsy could not join us because she went to her friends LAMO wedding
Bets what is more important???? A WEDDING
or Dodgeball at the Drafthouse?? I see where you priorities are and i dont like it
Anyway it was fun and enjoyable
Especially since Dodgeball is funnier everytime you see it
trust me i have seen it 3 times
Dena and Los ordered TWO BUCKETS OF BEER
They were drunk
I opted for a dr
pepper and a cheeseburger
The only problem with the evening was the fact that I have come to the conclusion that EVERY employee at the Drafthouse is mentally disabled
Our waiter gave our food and bill to the wrong people
TWICE and me and Mike's ticket was 28$ so we gave him 42 because all we had was twenties
He didnt bring us any change!!! SO after the movie was out we asked him where our change was and he THOUGHT he was getting a 13 dollar tip
im sorry but i do try and be generous on the tipping thing
but not 50 %
He was retarded
I then took my change back and gave him 4 bucks
(Which i still feel is overly generous for a guy who expects a 50% tip)
Anyway it was fun all in all
Today was fulllllll of excitment
First this morning me dena mike and Los got a game of poker going
We didnt have money or chips so we played with saltine crackers
It was fun
This was my first time to play poker (if you dont count alcoholic strip poker
) So they had to teach me
But all i was really interested in was eating the saltines
i was hungry
SO after i went out I kept sneaking denas crackers
She ended up winning anyway so really it didnt matter
A girls gotta eat, plus i figured i was being economical
eating the same FREE crackers that we used for our entertainment which otherwise would have probably costed money
not only for food, BUT the entertainment as well
After that we went to the pool because mikes apt complex had a 4th of july party there and had free beer/coke and pizza
I didnt have a bathing suit tho so i had to borrow erin's sports bra and
(cringe cringe) Mike's speedo which SADLY fit me perfectly
Um i have a large ass
Anyway I looked like a swimmer
The sports bra was loose too so it kind of suctioned up when i swam and practically became another layer of skin and you could totally see my boobs, no bra, no wire, no padding
i could tell everyone was jealous of my extremely freakishly large boobs
Me dena and mike played truth or dare
but it only lasted one and a half rounds
We quite after i got dena to dance in front of everyone for 10 seconds and go under the waterfall adn try to look sexy
This isnt really a dare though because we all know how dena is and the whole 'sex appeal' thing, she always looks like she is trying to be dirty
even when she walks
Anyway after that we went to the park and me dena mike and erin played Disc Golf
LOTS of fun!!!! I am getting better
But mike of course is a God at disc golf and Erin somehow had beginners luck so they both kicked my ass
This black family was at the park we were playing at and they were all walking toward a picnic bench while two of them had LARGE speakers on a gurny type thing
They then proceeded to plug them in and turn up their christian rap as loud as they possibly could
Nothing like some good ole christian rap while you play a game of disc golf
THEN me and dena came back to klein and my fam had a bbq by the pool
Kelcee came over and we ate our fajitas and went in the hot tub
IF you have seen the movie 'Saved' then you probably remember the part where the girl and the guy go under water in the pool and yell out secrets
Well thats what we were doing except not secrets
we  just had to guess what the other person was saying
You can never hear what the people are saying but it was fun anyway
One time i picked to say a really long sentence and i started choking on water which i found funny and began laughing at the same time
Nothing like talking, laughing and choking under water all at once
Most of our sentences were something like this:  'Dena likes transexuals' 'Dena just farted' 'dena likes to have sex with Oscar (our dog)' 'Dena likes penis'  We are so immature
To finish up the night my whole family and kelcee played poker
This time we used chips
There were eight of us and I WON! Im such a poker shark
You wish you were me
Here are the final stats:  1
ME -Poker Pokerson the Great 2
Brianna (my 12 year old sister) 3
Kelcee -balla extrordinair the rest dont matter
just kidding
But not really
Ok well im off to bed
We are waking up early to go to huntsville to fish and have a picnic
Me mike kelcee carlos dena and maybe betsy
It should be fun
I will end my blog with a quote from betsy on the phone earlier:  (after i asked her to come fishing with us) 'I dont know if I really want to catch a fish and watch it die
OK!!!!!!!!!'  Holla
I think I may have jumped the gun
Some of my sources say that St

Sorry for the error
I've really got to get a life
This is way too many entries in one day but what are you going to do, sue me?  I was going through yet another notebook full of scribbling, news clippings, pictures and things and came across this:  These moments of solitude, with my music and mind
Life flashing in front of my eye
A pond's calm drowns me
The vastness of the world boils inside
Passion and hope become headlights that guide me through my fear, your fear
I'm standing in the shallows hoping the tide won't come
If it does, may I find the ability to swim
I ranted earlier about writer's getting stuff like this published
It's all disconnected and  random
I remember writing this while driving around with friends
In the car was a girl I was madly in love with, she knew it, but we never seemed to get together
It was very complicated and confusing
Parts of the poem are about what was happening at the time and other parts are just lines that came to me that I thought sounded neat
I think the first stanza is about riding around with her and being in my own little world where nobody else knows what I'm thinking or feeling
After that I think I just wrote down a bunch of stuff that was coming to me in flashes
I like the third stanza
The idea of being knee deep in trouble and hoping there is a way to overcome it before it washes over you is a neat idea to work with
The visuals of a tide coming in while you're stuck in the mud watching the water rise above your head and not knowing if you can survive works really well
I think people can identify with that
That is the end of the lesson for today class
Tune in tomorrow as Professor Cody talks about the use of  words to convey mood
I found a quote I copied into my notebook from Arthur Kent, a Canadian foreign correspondent
I wish it were true today
All journalists have a special mission, whether they're working in life-threatening situations or explaining events at city hall
It's called accuracy: putting the truth on public record, no matter who that truth might offend
It's about having enough courage to earn profits without distorting or dressing up the facts
Ethics do not constitute a handicap, as too many media owners seem to believe
They're assets, and when nurtured with care, they become vital ingredients to success
To Her…   I’m sorry for causing you much undue pressure or burdening you with such an issue as this, but it can’t be helped in one way or another you would have found out
Either from our friends, from other people or from me… I decided on the latter
In my opinion, it would have been better if it came directly from me but now the question became when the right time was to tell you how I felt
I’ve been pondering on this thought for quite some time now,  putting myself under my own manipulation and control
Sometimes it came to a point that  I was about to tell you but I didn’t … why I have no idea
I confessed my feelings for you today,  I told you I liked you
Why? Well because on my way to your home, it hit me… There is no point in waiting for the right time if the person I would tell isn’t there anymore
I’d hate what usually happens in movies like when someone dies, someone usually has a line that goes, “if only…” I do not want that to happen
The right time for me is right now
I do not expect anything grand in return, all I ask is for you to let me know what’s on your mind…
Sagittarius May 17, 2004        Daily Teen   You may feel like daydreaming all day about that guy or girl you have a crush on

Boy, am I tired
I went to rehab this morning
Left the house at 7, only had to go 12 miles
Took me nearly 45 minutes
I did the treadmill, the bike, the pro bike (with the different settings to make it harder, like you were really going to ride a bike with your hands  and   feet pumping at the same time) and listened to a lecture on angioplasty that a sixth-grade schoolgirl could have sat in on and then answered the questions
There were actually patients in the class who did not know what the main purpose of an angioplasty was
Incredible, especially when you realize that most of them had been through one (or two)
I am the youngest person in the 8am group
Funny thing is, three years ago I was the youngest person in the group
Anyway, then I followed this morning's work with 12 hours of solid work at work
Tomorrow, I have to be up at 6am again, and do the rehab thing again, except that I have to go to work at 10am, so that I can be home by 9:30pm, so that I can go to bed, so that I can be up at 4:30am on Friday to be at work at 5:30am
This is going to be a long eight weeks of rehab
But I've lost 17 pounds since the end of April
Perhaps I was giving off negative vibes today on the metro, but every darn guy was stepping on my toes, bumping me with his briefcase, side-swiping me with elbows, etc
Although, each did say 'excuse me
'    I got into work to find an email asking for a change on a previously submitted request
Hello out there - do you really think I have time to do things twice or three times?  Does anyone have 2 neurons to rub together? Huh???  For some reason, this makes me think of the book  The Roaches Have No King , by Daniel Evan Weiss  (thanks, Aunt Joan!)

I biked to my library today and on the way passed my mom who then decided to tell me she had just picked up my book
Well, at least I can still go to the bank, I thought
It was about then that I realized that I had left my money, a home
Great day so far
got woken up early, (12;50pm), couldn't pick up my book, bikes a piece of shi*, got cramps going on, and I forgot my money
The good news is that I now only have $8 dollars on my card and I found a giant cat fish in a stream near the library good for a Monday though way, yester-night at the very stroke of midnight, my radio turned itself on! I was highly surprised as I was reading
I also felt a warmth in my chest
Two minutes later, my folder fell! I think it was mainly me, but I think my old friend, The Presence, came back these 'dreams' happened when I was half awake me explain
At the end of December last, as I was waking up around midnight (I have really odd sleeping habits)
In my dream------
I was sleeping  on a mat that had four chairs surrounding it
I was at a sleepover and my friends were sleeping on the chairs
I dozed of then re-awoke in the corner of the room( which was very large and had nothing in it) and it was my be
There was something over me and it was naked to my eye(invisible)
It was very malevolent and I could feel it as an aura
I was under the blanket and my head was to the side
IT began to blow/whisper in my ear
I tried to cover it with the edge of my pillow but couldn't
I tried screaming and thrashing but I had no control over anything
I then got control of my arms and tried to hit it but there was nothing there to hit! I being myself was never afraid of it but I hate being controlled finally left and I awoke
my second dream goes like this----- I was in my room sitting on my mattress talking to Aaron on my new phone when I felt it enter nearly rushed in and I felt it coming and knew what IT was
I was going to tell Aaron about it when it got control over my voice
I struggling fiercely for a few seconds when it left my room
I was wondering why it had left me without doing anything to me when it rushed at me again
It did this process 3 times I awoke and got angry with it then marveled at how it was doing this and for what purpose
the third one occurred as such on Monday, January 5 or 12------ I was in my bed in the same position as in the waking world, body straight and fingers clenched
Suddenly, the PRESENCE was at my side
Not malevolent in any way,but there
I tried to talk but again, I couldn't
IT began laughing and then IT spoke! IT's word went something like this 'You don't have
' and the rest was lost as I awoke
those are my PRESENCE 'dreams'
I know that they aren't just dreams but something of a another sort
I have nothing to influence them in any way
No movies, conversations, pictures, nothing
It might just be a poltergeist *tucking* me out from my slumber
Whatever IT is, its as if its testing me
In the first, it enchants me by whispering in my ear
Then it tests me of my strength, then it even talks to but of what I hope to learn
Then it checks upon me periodically
What does this mean? Why me?Oh well, why try

Oh ya, during the audition, lil' josh was saying I was weird and stuff right in front of the director and cooper's like 'no he's not, he's kool' and seriously, there was like a 5 second silence in the room that was too quiet

HA HA, i just wanted to say that, BYE!  Me
011004105112-Rochester, NY---  One of the biggest arguments over the last few years, on the opinion pages and on Usenet, and more recently in the Blog responders, tends to pop up when the name of Hitler is invoked as a standard for comparison
The usual leftist mantra runs that when we compare (insert Hillary here) to Hitler, ala 'Hitlery', it's a sure sign that the person doing such comparisons is running out of valid points, and has certainly lost both the argument and any credibility inside or outside of said discussion
So here comes The George Soros hit squad called MOVEON, with it's recent competition, wherein they posted ads from their followers making exactly that comparison
MOVEON, of course is swearing they didn't know, they're not responsible, they regret not having caught the ads before they made it to the site, and so on
MoveOn
org spokesman Trevor Fitzgibbon said, 'we had no idea the Hitler thing even existed
'  So, what rock have you been living under, Trevor? Have you even been reading the output of your rank and file supporters? Have you even been actually reading your own website?  A look in alt
politics will give you the clue
Even a shallow search of Google's Usenet portal displays hundreds of thousands of posts and their replies, most going back years
A similar search on the web pages shows an even larger number of hits
I find it hard to fathom that a group of people so centered on the net wouldn't know this kind of non-thinking was out there
Sorry, this innocent act doesn't wash
This is Soros driving this
If you think Hitler comparison is not part and parcel of the Democrats and their political smear campaign, ask yourself a question: Which one of the nine wannabees will stand up and speak out against the trend that's been noted here?  None, I expect
We've not seen them do so yet, and I doubt there will be any
No, the silence on this one will remain
The reason for their silence is clear enough; They think they benefit from it,  or at the least, they think denouncing these tactics will harm them with the core Democrat voter
OK, admittedly, those are just the leaders of the party, and may not reflect the views of the Democrat rank and file
So, lets test that aspect, by asking a similar question
Where are the Democrat rank and file speaking out on the news channels, and in the public forums? Where are the letters of protest? There are few; because so many of them don't disagree with the portrayal of Bush as worse than Hitler
And more, is it just a relative few who are generating all this internet traffic making this absurd comparison?   No, the silence on this one from the Democrat rank and file, too, will remain
This collective silence from the whole of the Democrat party speaks volumes, I think
I've brought these points up in various discussion groups over the last few days, and have been told  on a few occasions that I'm letting a few radicals define the Democrat party
Aside from balking at the phrase 'a few'
let me submit that leftist radicalism IS the Democrat party of today
The argument is easy to make and hard to defeat, because words mean things
Allow me to point out that 'radical' is from words meaning, literally, 'from the root'
I don't think it can be denied that the ads under discussion here, are if nothing else, radical left, and given the definition of the word radical, they demonstrate clearly where the roots of the Democrat party are today
Here's a few examples of Democrat rank and file:  http://hatebush

shtml  http://altahemp

html  http://sandiego
indymedia
org/en/2003/04/5626
shtml  (Be forewarned, the last one is particularly weird
)  There are of course thousands more examples of this kind of Democrat hate, and proof of where it comes from
But here's the bottom line: Even if you assume MOVEON's innocence in the matter
(a large unwarranted assumption, in my view) this incident still exposes what is driving the left
Sheer hatred, and nothing more, even by their own definitions
I've said this for years, for all the lip service they pay to 'stopping hate'
with them it's not that you hate, or not, but what you hate
This is not love of country driving these people, it's hatred for it
This is desperation in search of a path back to power
One can certainly understand their motivations, here
Consider their plight;  President Bush has Iraq fully in hand, and we now know where the WMD are, (Syria) that the left has been claiming Mr
Bush was lying about
Here's the Blog entry I did a few days ago, containing lots of links to stories the left hopes you'll never see
The Afghan people have a new constitution, (another story you didn't know about, thanks to our supposedly mainstream press) and the Taliban, what there is left of them, are on the run
Their supports removed, the PLO is no longer a major factor
Libya has fallen into line
Korea, as well
On the domestic front, President Bush has managed to get a drug bill into law that the left has never been able to, even when they held power in all three branches, by a wider margin than the Republicans do today, indicating the success rates they'll have at getting the job done when given more of a majority
Bush also has the Domestic economy flying high, the markets are sailing along as they have not done since Ronald Reagan was in office
Look at the numbers for the last year: DJIA +25
3% S&P 500 +26
4% Nasdaq +50
0%   Jobless rates are coming back down, pay is going up, productivity is also going up
The states are back out of the financial trouble they were in under Bill Clinton
Speaking of which, the American public need not be concerned anymore about their president having the sexual behavior of the average stray terrier, humping every leg that comes by
In the overall, respect for the office has now been reinstated, and Americans are feeling pretty good about their country
As a result, the polls are continuing to show Mr
Bush with sky-high approval ratings, week on week on week
All these trends are looking like they will continue to improve, with Bush at the helm
Here's the rub for the Democrats in all of this
In any election, the task set before anyone seeking to oust an incumbent, is to convince the voting public that moving away from the incumbent and his policies, are in the interests of that voting public, and the country as a whole
So, the Democrats are desperate because, bluntly, their task of explaining to the voter why replacing the man responsible for all this good news, is in their best  interest, is getting ever more impossible, and frankly downright laughable
All the Democrats can offer is moves away from what is demonstrably working well
In short, they're hoping the American voter is stupid
But, from now on, when you hear about this MOVEON outrage, this Hitler/Bush being pushed by George Soros and tolerated by the Democrat leaders and agreed with by the Democrat rank and file, you need to think about this:   If we're to take them at their word of just a few short Monica kneepad sessions ago, they're telling us, they're running out of options, and have certainly lost both the argument and any credibility inside or outside of said discussion
And, they most certainly don't deserve our vote

Useful idiots - that's the ironic phrasing I was looking for
Jorja Fox  ('Sara Sidle' on ' CSI ') has  been rehired
&nbsp;  George Eads  ('Nick Stokes', also  on ' CSI ') claims to have  overslept the day of the firing,  is  very apologetic and is asking to return as well
claims it was never about  the money
&nbsp;     Personally, I hope  both of 'em get back
not necessarily for their own sakes but for the sake of a  really good show
I happen to like seeing 'red meat' at political conventions
Today's conventions are too scripted
The campaigns from both sides are trying to put a 'moderate face' on their candidates
This is IMO a disservice to the voters
Having said all this, the Kerry campaign is probably not to happy about Reverand Al's speech last night
He didn't follow the script very well or at all
I watched the speech on CNN
After he was done you could almost see Judy Woodruff blowing a gasket
She looked pissed off
After all, she and most others in the media are liberal, and she knows as well as anyone that Al's speech did not play well in Peoria as they say
In fact, I think it turned off many swing voters
They then went to Candy Crowley behind the podium to interview the Reverend after the speech
Her first question: 'Was that speech approved by the Kerry campaign?', Al's answer: 'I got approval for the tone of the speech from them(I highly doubt that)', Candy then followed up with this question: 'were your actual words approved Reverend Sharpton?' Al's answer: 'I told them that I needed to answer Bush's speech from last Friday's Urban League meeting'
I then switched channels to Chris Matthews
He was livid also! How dare this man come out and give a red meat speech like he did! The only saving grace for Kerry is that most people probably did not and will not see or hear about Al's speech
Well now, the roommates talked to me this evening
Here's how it transpired:  The roommates have a bunch of guys who come over all the time
Well the guys always come into my room and talk with me as well
One of the guys called me after he left and asked me to tell one of the roommates something
I then explained to him that they don't talk to me therefore I wasn't relaying any messages to them
Along the conversation went, and the guy wound up calling my roommates and gave them hell for not being nice to me
Well, with all that arm twisting, they finally talked to me
I know we will never be 'friends', but at least now we may be able to converse in passing
They're not leaving tonight, they're leaving tomorrow (Thursday) at 1PM, and are coming back Saturday night
The two I talked to, Sarah and Amber, both seemed OK
They are in my Psych of Human Sexuality class; they're minors are both Psych
I can't remember what they're majors are, or even if they told me
Oh well
It's raining again!  I swear, it's never going to stop
OK, I'm going to watch the Cosby Show and then go to bed

My Linux project moved on a tiny bit - I cannot say I am out of the shit I jived into voluntarily, but at least I have some dim conception how to get on, so we will just see
By the way, CA, who I met today afternoon was  so  glad that I gave it up; he was really disappointed when I had to inform him that I started it over
Maybe I am just too proud (stupid) to admit that I have nor the knowledge nor the experience nor the wits to get on with such a comlicated piece of technology
Today I hunted for a cell phone wich is compatible with my palmtop - I did not succeed, since the phone model I was looking for is kinda antique these days
I was so disappointed that I repaired my own in an instant when I arrived home
I have never done anything like this before, and it definitly seems that I succeeded; this means that I will be able to update my blogs when I am not at home or anywhere near proper civilization
Tomorow I am going to travel far from  any  civilization so it will be very handy - don't worry I will keep you informed
It's two conferences and I think they will be really terrible

I don't know much about that gmail and luckily I haven't had to deal with uptight CBC newscaters
but, I did have something kind of fun happen at work last week
I was working late and got the chance to meet Ashlee Simpson, Jessica Simpson's sister!  Her whole entourage, including MTV, were there!  It's interesting to watch these 'nouveau celebs' and how they interact with people who can make and break 'em, but the cool part is I'll get to  be on MTV! :)  Who said work can't be fun!  I guess getting up at 3:30am does have some perks! On another note, I saw the movie/documentary 'Control Room,' all about Al Jazeera and the war in Iraq
It was pretty good and it was even better watching it in a theater with Americans
The footage and people interviewed were similar to some films we saw in class, but it was interesting to see it outside of school
to be able to evaluate it and discuss it with 'non-journalists'
Argh, I'm not good enough at writing to articulate what I want to say
More revisions to come later
One of the biggest stumbling blocks in my faith up until a few months ago was my fuzzy definition of faith; I wasn't sure if my faith was deep or believing enough
This was partly because I had only been a Christian for a few years and was thus unsure of myself, and was also because of a weird example of faith: God eminently exists just as a chair eminently exists, so one's faith in God should be as taken-for-granted as having faith that one's chair will not fall apart upon one's sitting down in that chair
Basically, I had trouble taking for granted God's existence and provision; I expected that believing in God was an emergent truth from observation
Since I wasn't as confident about my faith in God as I was about my faith in my chair not falling apart, I seriously questioned myself, which was sort of good
A few months ago it occured to me that having faith in God does not necessitate one being confident in him in the same way one is confident in a chair
Exodus (particularly Exodus 4): When Moses was first starting out as a leader, God told him to go lead the Israelites who were slaves at the time, and that he would provide Moses with the necessary speaking skills &c
Moses replied that he wasn't much of a speaker and generally doubted his ability to lead the Israelites, even though God had told him directly to do so and that he would provide him with whatever was necessary
God responded by scolding Moses, who ended up leading the Israelites out of Egypt, parting the Red Sea, and the rest is history
Here, I see that Moses doubted; I see his faith wavering a little bit
Indeed, when he first started talking to the Israelites, it's very possible he was scared and unsure of himself even though God had told him directly to do it
What's important here is that even Moses, one of the great men of faith in history, had doubts about God, who was in some ways more eminently real to him than to us (that is not to say that we today can not have faith like Moses did)
He showed his faith by ultimately doing what God told him to do, even though he had personal doubts--indeed, when Moses first started out, it seems that he wasn't as confident in his faith in God as he was in more mundane things
Acts (particularly Acts 6-7) When Stephen presented his defense of Jesus and of himself to the Sanhedrin, it never once says that he spoke without stuttering a little bit or being afraid (indeed fear would be reasonable as he was martyred)
It never says that Stephen spoke with complete confidence and had and absolute command over fear or doubt; it just says that he spoke
This is stretching beyond the passage, I know, but it seems quite reasonable to me that Stephen was afraid here, that Stephen could have been completely unconfident about Jesus here
But again, I see a man overcoming any and all fears and acting in a way that was according to God's will
In both Moses and Stephen, I see an overcoming of doubt followed by acting according to God's will
I do not see senseless, take-God-for-granted actions
I see force of will overcoming doubt--the quintessence of faith
im so hardcore
i had to get up at 5am on sat to go to work
i did a 12 hour shift, followed by a two hour bus journey home (trains cancelled- engineering work), didnt have any tea, and i still had the energy to go to my best mans housewarming party
AG is my best man, im his best man
thats the deal
when i eventually get married he'll be the dude sortin stuff out
when he gets married (possibly in the not so distant future), i will be organising the stag etc, which i already have embryonic plans for
party was cool
woeful music though, as is usually the case at these things
what a day yesterday was
im so pooped!  me and kareen headed out with will to sf in the morning and did shopping shopping shopping
not too crazy though- well at least not me!  it sure is tiring shopping!  then we headed over to metreon and watched the 2:30 showing of divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood- it was SUCH a chick flick! haha
then me and kareen had sashimi at the sushi place in metreon- it really wasnt that good, i still like sushi house better!  then will met up with us and we went to macys cuz he wanted to try out those dockers pants? the ones with the hidden pocket? hehe
- which he bought two pairs of!  then we headed home on the bart and andy picked us all up at the ashby bart station
then we headed home and watched the lakers game!  by this time me and kareen were so pooped she fell asleep and i had a headache so i took a nap
we woke up when the game ended and we headed to baja fresh and then to go see sum of all fears at emerybay
but it was pretty much sold out so we ended up watching undercover brother- which actually wasnt bad as i was expecting it to be!  but yes what a long day
today we're going to a wedding!  i hope i have time to get my hair cut this morning- its really getting too long
but we'll see about the time constraints
i'll let u know more about it when we get back! byee!

WOW, what a week
Work has been extremely CRAZY
The Europe side of the Business seems to be in shambles- and the low morale seems to be spreading to the North America side
Fronting competition rumors, and still trying to bring NEW business - it is never dull
Rachel comes home from Las Vegas tonight
It has been weird to be without my child for a week,way too quiet
Of course I had grande/romantic notions of a week alone with my hubby with the kid, but LIFE got in the way
Guess that happens when you have been married 25 years
The weather has been beautiful this week in Indiana, 70's during the day, 60's at night, cool breezes
The way Summer is suppose to be
I am trying to get to a good place work wise so I can enjoy a week of vacation next week
Off to Michigan
First to Frankenmuth and then to Mackinac Island for 4 days
Just can't wait to be near the water and relax
Well I got to run and get ready to head to Indy, first dinner than the Airport
I'll keep you update on the Mother and Child Reunion
Thanks for letting me talk
she wrote the note in a haze of confusion, lost, blinded
searching i suppose
hoping to reach out
she's thinking about taking this down again, it's becoming redundant and she thinks she needs change
or at least a break a while
she's gotten too used to falling into depressive states and writing things off in a non committal way
she's thinking she needs to live in the real world a while
experience the consequences and strengthen her actions
actions speak louder than words   an afternoon with herself and the old man
a special gift
thank you you
i'm taking this from one of the emails i got today, cause well, i'm having ANOTHER rough go at it:  'There is something to be said about finding your own path
It helps to fall on your face a couple of times and pick yourself up instead of waiting for someone else to do it for you
Luv we all have issues that is what makes us human and not machines
Moving in with your brother may give Brian a role model, someone who had to make the decisions on his own, struggle a bit, earn his way
That is what I was talking about a couple of weeks ago, you know what the value of hard work is, you understand that working hard is the only way to make something out of yourself and to fullfill your ambitions, and you have ambition
That is why you are not home scratching yourself and watching TV
After a nap on the carpet and a few chapters of Animal Farm, I'm off to watch the Disney Robin Hood in espanol
I also have Alicia en el Pais del Maravillas
Dunno why, just to help me keep up with Spanish or something
I love this movie, it was one of my favorites growing up along with Dark Crytal and the Rats of Nimh
The latter two haven't survived the passage of time though, Nimh being nowhere near as good as the book, and Crystal now too bizarre for me
WIT's shows are up and running again, and have been selling out like crazy
Excellent
Yes, the show and the situation of selling out
GO to  urlLink DCWIT  for deets
I also heard Katie on the radio today talking about some classic improv, great she's out and about again and that she's doing shows this run
Muy excelente
Also cooking again, bought lots of meat and dairy, and should have some good food for the week and not be lazy enough to end up buying meals like last time
Ok, off to see the video
it was a sexy day
sorry, had to post that
was watching sex in the city last night (earlier morning) with my friend and that line was used as the opener to a journal
who does that?  so new years came and went without much excitement
i volunteered to be the dd so i kept it at 2 guinesses for the night
the other 5 ppl in my car got pretty drunk and had a very good time
everyone got home safe and that's what really matters
of course i would have had liked a kiss at midnight from someone, oh well
found out that my upstairs neighbor is friends with my friend via school
maybe she'll come down and party with me now?
Today my friend and I decided to compare our vaginas and discovered that we look complete different from one another; somewhere I heard that there are three main versions of the human vagina
Although we share many of the same physical characteristics, such as, our skin and hair color, my friend and I are complete opposites when it comes to the between our legs part
For instance, her lips fold outward where as mine fold inward
Now, we both have full lips but my clitoris is placed higher up than hers
So, with hers, I guess the lucky man could slurp up her juices and kiss her button all at once
Where as with mine, he could keep his lips somewhat dry; sounds crazy, right?  But these are things that you may not think of before taking the dive -or do you, gentlemen?  Well, I guess you'll just have to decide whether or not your a juicer
Now, thats not to say that you could be a juicer and not be with me; you'll just have to dig deeper
Well, thats really what its all about, when it comes down to it, isn't it -just how deep your willing to go
And, for me, you better go deep
I once loved someone who loved me back
But he didn't want to stay
so I had to let him go
I cried
I spent countless nights  wondering what went wrong, muffling my sobs with my pillows so my parents wouldn't suspect that something’s amiss
I'd reminisce about our happy times, then break down when I realize that he’s no longer mine
I analyzed every single  detail of our breakup
I wrote long e-mails to my closest friends
I talked endlessly about my situation
I spent my nights in tearful telephone conversations and my days in daydreams where we'd end up in each other's arms again
Sometimes he’s still my angel, still my knight in shining armor who I'd do anything for just to have back
But sometimes, I see him as the devil incarnate who broke my heart in the worst  possible way, and who deserved to be horsewhipped at the very least
I told myself that it was all for the better
That this is what’s best for the both of us
That this is God's plan
My friends offered similar advice, none of which I hadn't heard before: 'It's a sign that you're not meant for each other,' 'When God closes a door, He opens a  window,' 'Someone better is coming for  you,' 'There are so many other fish in the sea,'  etc
But it didn't work
Because deep down, I still believed that he is the one, the only one
And I couldn't understand how this is all for the better
when everyday seemed more torturous than the last
not being able to be with him the way I wanted to be, seeing him so  unaffected, and dealing with my broken-and- smashed heart and my bruised ego
I tried to immerse myself in other activities to forget about him
I went out a lot and tire myself to sleep
I filled my schedule with T
and movie marathons, shopping sprees, and Music  Maniax
It worked for a while
but then there were times ? times when my mind was cleared of the busy thoughts, I tried to occupy it with ? that I would think of him
His memory would sneak up to me on tiptoes, catching me in my  most vulnerable moments
I tried to show the world that I am OK
that I am over him
that it was fine just being friends
I didn't go around with a big 'X' on my forehead, nor did I go around with puffy eyes and tissue box
I tried to live my life as I knew it before I met him
People thought that I  was doing great
They heard me laugh and they saw me smile; I seemed happy, they said; and I told myself that I am
But in the solace of my room, where I tried to organize my thoughts and sort out my feelings, I had to admit to myself that I am not truly happy
Because I am still yearning for  someone, and my heart still ached for something that could not be
It's been over a month now since we broke up
Surprisingly, things have gotten better
I've changed
Somewhere along the way, I realized that he’s not the only one out there for me
I also realized that there were valid, powerful reasons why we split up
And I' ve become stronger, older, wiser
He's changed as well -- when I look at him, sometimes I still see the boy I fell in love with
Sometimes I think that he's the same person
he still has the same goofy smile and mischievous charm that I fell for, and I like to believe that the rest of him is unchanged as well
But then I take a closer look and I realize that he HAS changed
that I don't know him anymore, not really
not enough to  love and care for him as I once did
Well I have had a productive morning!!  Let's see: I have organized, somewhat, my graduate school stuff
At least I kind of know what I need to prepare and all
So my list is as follows: Indiana University UW (of course, the more I miss it the more it becomes appealing) Univ of Michigan DePaul (oooo chicago) ASU (kickass music building) USC--this I am skeptical on but Sean really recommends Terry Craven as a teacher so what the heck
I'm wondering if I should expand my options a little and look outside of the US
But what I'm hoping is that maybe these options will open up to me as I experience a little more of the professional world, and, hopefully, get taken more seriously as a trombonist
So I think for now I will stay here
I'm kind of excited about what will be known henceforth as the 'Midwest Tour' in which I will schedule my auditions for UW, IU, UM and DePaul in the same time period and thus get to visit the Madison kids, Katie, Grant, and maybe Val respectively
Or anyone else in Chicago
The exciting part is that I have a place to stay at all of these schools so it will be fun
:) If only I could rent a car!!! gr
Also, I polished up my letter to the local middle schools about teaching and sent it off to Sean to have him proof it
I stopped by RBHS last night and got from him a list of all (ALL) the schools in CALIFORNIA (what the fuck), and now I must muck through this ENORMOUSLY LONG LIST and find the ones in SAN DIEGO
Well they have addresses and all
I was pissed off immensely when, after I had finished copying all FIFTY pages I realized that the stupid ^@*%^~@%^$ band office copy machine had continously been cutting off the left hand side of the page, thus depriving me of one third of ALL THE SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA
So I ran through and just wrote down the ones in SD
The band office copy machine has been doing this to people since forever
Since I had to copy stuff for marching band and pep band and all the things in between
You'd think it'd be time
but well, arts education, haha, has no money
Anyway, once Sean sends that back to me I can send it out to ALL THE SCHOOLS IN SAN DIEGO and hopefully get some students
And maybe some coaching gigs
I also am applying for a job at Bernardo Heights Middle School (my alma mater) as a music assistant
Woohoo! It looks like fun: I get to do some conducting and chamber stuff, and basically just assist
In the production of music
Of course it is a middle school band and occasionally I have memories of the terrors we inflicted in middle school upon our poor director
Well, it's a job anyway
Last night was Googaloo rehearsal
Only we didn't really rehearse
We went to Adam's house and goofed off, basically
Adam wanted to clean up some charts and put some four-part harmony in, since we have added to the horn section Pierre, on tenor
He's french! He has a french accent! I think he might be scared of us
I told all my naughty jokes to Lenny, since we were pretty bored
We played with rubber chickens
Adam burned me a Poncho Sanchez-Freddie Hubbard cd
And a Johnny Cash cd but I get that next week
It was quite fun and I feel refreshed and like I have friends, or at least goofing off partners, whom I will see at least once a week
Well, I'm still stuffy headed and going swimming is unappealing
I think I will do yoga instead, and call that my exercise for today
Christ
Speaking of which, I really want to go and see the new Jesus movie, but it seems I'm in short supply of friends who feel the need to see it
I mean, sure I know how it ends with everyone's favorite bearded son dangling from the crossbeams, but that doesn't necessarily ruin it, right?  Oh
Sorry if you didn't realize how everything turned out in the end
*SPOILERS!*  But seriously, I'm thinking this is going to have to be one of those movies I go and see myself
Just like when you talk about politics with people, religion has a tendency to cause massive rufflings of feathers and I won't be able to help but talk about some of the stuff I've seen
It's too bad, really
I'm usually very interested in where people draw their beliefs and what kind of background brought them to the faith (or non-faith in my case) they currently hold dear
Why do people have to get so worked up over it?  Believe what you want, how you want, whenever you want
It's simple
For Chrissakes
hey people!!! my birthday just pass and i'm trying to get a new blog
i just can't do it
confusing
Ahmed Chalabi         U
Aids Raid on Home of Chalabi   Iraqi police backed by U
soldiers on Thursday raided the home of Ahmed Chalabi, a Governing Council member who was once the Pentagon's pick to run postwar Iraq
Officials later said they were seeking 15 people, including at least one member of Chalabi's Iraqi National Congress, on charges including fraud and kidnapping
In coordinated searches, U
troops seized computers, files and dozens of rifles from two offices of the Iraqi National Congress, a coalition of political parties that opposed former president Saddam Hussein
Boot prints marked several doors kicked down in the raids, which included a top-to-bottom search of the INC intelligence center that U
authorities once turned to for help in searching for former top Hussein officials and weapons of mass destruction
A visibly agitated Chalabi told reporters after the raids that they were retribution for his increasingly strident criticism of the American management of post-Hussein Iraq
'I call to liberate the Iraqi people and get back our complete sovereignty,' he said, speaking in English, 'and I am raising these issues in a way that the Americans don't like
'  But Hussein Muathin, a judge with the Central Criminal Court of Iraq, said the raids were part of an investigation into such crimes as the detaining and torturing of people, theft of government cars and illegal seizure of government facilities
Eight people, including Aras Habib, Chalabi's security and intelligence chief, have been declared fugitives
Chalabi was not charged
and Iraqi officials said that the arrest orders originated in the Iraqi justice system, and that senior U
occupation officials did not know about the warrants until they were served
The raids appeared to complete Chalabi's fall from grace in the eyes of U
officials over the last difficult year of the occupation
In recent weeks, occupation authorities have cut off a $335,000 monthly subsidy to the INC's intelligence arm and have pursued an investigation focusing on alleged fraud against government agencies by Sabah Nouri, a Chalabi aide who served as the anti-corruption chief at the Ministry of Finance
This pressure comes as occupation officials are preparing to hand limited authority to Iraqis on June 30 and oppose a government role for such former allies as Chalabi
The raids alarmed other members of the U
-appointed Governing Council, several of whom called on the United States to apologize to Chalabi immediately
'Doing such a thing to a Governing Council member proves that they do not acknowledge this council, which they formed and appointed,' said Songul Chapouk, a council member and women's rights activist
'This is an insult to this council

Hello everyone!  Well a random happy blog today going out to everyone
Its weird because i know if i wanted i could angst about a lot of things tonight, but i just dont wanna think about them at the moment
I guess my works been keeping me busy, been doing a bit of writing and also mainly trying to boost up over the wall of freewebs shit hosting a website to play in the garden of internet, and so far here it is!   urlLink The Crypt Of Benjamin The Immortal   Yes so if im a very good boy the master of Internet Puppets himself, Bald will attach it to World Of Angst!  so yay hoopla to that!  So some of you people who are very bored at this moment
lol i know thats the only reason you read this, 'What did Ben get up to today on this less than great day!' Well i will tell you, mostly hacked this website into the net all morning but in the afternoon me and Mr Adam Chapman went for a bit of a adventure round some of the more secret bits and bobs of Spondon
Woot very cool stuff, wish id bought my camera as we discovered the water resovoir for spondon, and its a very old creepy delabated bomb shelter style place with a amazingly scary resident evil style rusty brown gate with razor wire crudley tied all over it

Open to Me
I want to cut you down to size
Split open your yellow belly
I want to stab you in the chest
I find nothing inside
I want to taste your flesh
One last time
Now you have just one thing to  Hide from me
Your hate from me
Hide your hate for me
If you'll just love me  For the rest of my life,  I'll kill myself tomorrow
Make yourself open to me
Give me this one thing
And I'll go away for the rest of our lives
(I was in a bad mood
Love can be nasty
Makes you say nasty things
so i'm a year older, and all that has changed is that i now got one more thing to worry and feel bad about
sitting at oskars yesterday morning with dirk, having (totally non vegan) breakfast, i got a 10-minute-quarter-life-crisis
26 suddenly seemed awfully close to 'late twenties', like almost 30
it just hit me that for years, i expected to live a different life at this age
like in melbourne, with a job, married, thinking about having kids
on some levels, i haven't totally dismissed these wishes
i want a life partner
i want to be done with uni
i want to lead the fullfilling life that i long for
it's ridiculous to feel bad about not having all that yet
i got to be patient with myself: i'm getting there, if slowly
it's been a strange last few years, i should be patient with myself, encouraging, instead of ashamed for not having reached my goals yet
at least i am still trying
a strange kind of sadness lingered on from that 10-minute-quarter-life-crisis, for the entire day
we did plenty of nice things yesterday, and i was painfully aware that it is a luxury to just dismiss everything that needs being done for half a day and go shopping for presents and to the movies
- but still
with birthday money from the parents i bought myself the fancy salad spinner i have been needing for ages (no more swirling salad around in a dishtowel for me) and two cds, wilco's 'a ghost is born' and eskobars 'a thousand last chances'
seriously good stuff
it was lovely to simply spend and hour at mller's cd department, as awful a place that is, just listening to new cds
i used to go cd shopping with evan a lot, and i miss that and being exposed to new music through him
later, dirk shopped with me for his present to me: lingerie, fire-engine red
really good stuff, lacy and see through, yet totally un-trashy
never owned red lingerie before, and this stuff is seriously hot
also got a squaky, inflatable nemo from dirk
so good i got a man in my life who knows and encourages my silly side
we had some birthday cake, too, and went out to see   urlLink hoellentour , a documentary by oscar-winning film maker pepe danquart on the 2003 tour de france, in the late afternoon
i had read all the rave reviews the docu had gotten all over the place
each and every one of those reviews is very much deserved
hoellentour is a fantastic piece of docu filimg that won't just appeal to tour de france junkies like me
it's got it all: great imagery and colouring, gentle observation of its subjects, fantastic music and timing
- and all that real life drama! that last time trial in the rain, when ullrich fell, could not have been 'scripted' any better
life makes for the best stories, after all
plus: i really really like erik zabel now
i was always kinda indifferent towards him, admiring his achievements on the bike (most green jersey wins, most stage wins, consistent riding over years etc
) but not caring *that* much about him
this film has totally changed my view of him: good grace, is he an adorable, lovely, funny man! he came across as a totally natural, hard working, extremely funny, loyal guy
no attitude whatsoever
the 2003 tour must have been a humbling experience for zabel, crashing badly early on, no green jersey, losing sprints to petacci in the first half of the tour (before petacci, the loser, quit at the first molehill)
zabel surely shows a lot of his true self in this docu
it's so funny to observe his relationship with rolf aldag: they seem like a long married couple with appropriate loving bickering and well defined roles (who gets which bed, who has control over the remote)
zabels happiness for aldag after winning the mountain jersey is totally genuine and loving
- one of the best moments of the docu, i'd say
in contrast to that winokurov seems hard to grasp, floating around in the team doing his thing (like, almost win the tour), without really any attachements to anyone
maybe it's just the language barrier, who knows
overall, it is amazing that pepe daquart got such intimate access to the entire telekom team
- and he definitely made the most out of it
he shows more though, than just the workings inside a team
danqart portrays the strangeness of the tour in its entirety (think 'caravane'!), the glorious scenery, the fans camping out in the alps and following the tour around, the historians who deem it the greatest sport event ever, the journalists, the little villages transformed for a day for the occasion
the racing scenes feel like music videos with their electro-jazz soundtrack by till brnner and flowing camera movements and close ups of feet, legs, gear changes
the post race scenes are a stark contrast to that, totally quiet, zabel ponmdering the race or barely staying awake as legedary telekom physio 'eule' massages his legs
i'll definitely watch the movie again, buy it when it gets out
its a much better 2003 tdf souvenir than any video that just shows the race as you got to see it on the telly anyway
am now even hotter for this years' tour than i was already
didn't think that was actually possible
in the evening, tina came over to watch the football with dirk and me
rigos and champagne were consumed and we screamed at the telly, but alas, germany lost and gets to come home
bummer
tina and dirk got along well, too, and that's good, because those two haven't gotten to know each other much yet
i'll keep watching the euro though: at least england is still in, so i can keep wearing my 'bored of the beckhams' shirt out
and well, there's sweden to watch, too, which are entertaining to look at because of  urlLink extremely   urlLink yummy   urlLink freddie   urlLink ljundberg
and portugal! figo! why not watch football for the men?  so yeah, the birthday is over, and some sadness still lingers on, and i have no real idea as to why
there's therapy tomorrow, and i quite simply do not feel like turning up there with these unresolved issues (yeah, i know, 'isn't that what therapy is supposed to be good for?'), because i don't feel like therapy at all right now
i don't want to deal with my issues, thank you very much, i got too much work to do right now
not that i have any illusions regarding those 200 something pages i should read before sunday afternoon
off to ip now
i got to remind myself that it's thursday
and  urlLink thursday, i love law , right? right

It all started on Monday when I was full of a cold and shivers and the like
I didn't go into work yesterday and I tried going in this morning but I didn't last long
My stomach is off too
in our campaign to physically force Abe to become blog-gy
I sent an email to him today at 15
36 hours, transcript is as follows:  You need to gecome a part of the blog, if you aren't already, so you can contribute to our absolutely riveting conversations
We need a new angle, and we believe you may hold the key to our success (no, I'm not off talking about the list again)
So, yes, I voted for Ursula to guide you through if you need it (I did) to register, and the rest is pretty straight-forward, and if you can't get the posting part down you should go join a colony of Emperor penguins, as apparently you share their amount of brain cells
Actually, I heard penguins were pretty smart
ANYWAY, we must unite in our cause and become one
All the better to see you with
I move that we all send variations of aforementioned email to him so that we may force him to become blog-gy
Something rather like the twelve 'you need to post something on the blog'x1000000 emails I sent last Wednesday
Somebody want to second my motion? *nod your head 'yes', someone*
I got up earlier due to bowel movements, looked at myself in the mirror and I looked fucked
Would've made  great photo
Better than the one on my photo page in which I look fucked without actually being fucked
The chair I'm sitting on feels higher than usual
Theheight cn be adjusted but it's not moving down
Maybe everything else has just lowered
Not sure what's happening tonight
I have to go out because I told my parents I couldn't babysit
Just now, though
bowel movements
sore stomach
Hopefully it'll pass
I think people want to go to Trash (u18s thing in the same vain as Privi)
Not going to knock it before I've tried it
Can't go if I'm needing a shite every two minutes
Two of my best friends are heading for New York City today
They are 'in flight' right now
This morning (at a gaspingly early 5:30 AM!) I took them to the airport
Aaron looked all 'meterosexual' in his nice black silk shirt & khaki pants, and  of course , Nissa always looks  loverly
So if you see them, and you're a New Yorker, say 'Hi from Kim
'  I got them doughnuts from Krispy Kreme-- they have a New York Cheesecake flavor-- on the way to take them to the airport, in a vain attempt to boost the cool factor of my souvenir
They'll think 'wow, this ::insert coolest souvenir ever:: is a little more than I was going to pay, but then, she DID bring us those doughnuts
'  Mwah ha ha ha ha
My evil plan is in play
And, like a true evil genius, I have revealed it way too soon and now will probably get a snow globe of Donald Trump's haircut
(But then, what if that's what I want?  Hmmmmm?)  One thing I'm secretly hoping for is the   urlLink Tiffany's Guide to Table Manners for Teens   (in a blue Tiffany's bag, of course!!) But then, I'm not sure they're going to the holy of holies while there
I know I'm not a teen, but I love this book
Back to the old grind on the  urlLink Women Writers Summer Issue
It's about halfway done now
Yay!  I rock the house man
I'll obviously tell you when all the new book reviews & stuff are posted
But you can look at it now, too
It's cool
But then, maybe you're not ready for it
(more reverse psychology
how I love my evil ways

At work, I use 2 different computer applications to record the time I spend on different projects each week
So why, in this information (electronic) age, do I still have to fill out a paper 'time sheet' in order to get paid?  Said time card to then sit on my boss's desk and not get turned in
I'm totally taking a break from Blurty
I can't type anymore about my day on there
the memories hurt too much
So I'll juss do it here
Yesterday was fun
I'm trying to think of what i did in the morning but nothing's comming to
I was prolly sleeping
nah wait i was
till like 1 o clock
Then I wondered about the place in which i call home till I found the phone to make human contact
Nicole was my first victim
Nothing happened over the course of the next 3 hours
Around 4 tho (DANG IT I MISSED MEN IN TIGHTS!!!) my aunt picked me up and Nicole and I went to this concert thing at FBC
No one showed up till an hour after we got there and nicole and I juss spent our time being intimidated and quiet
When we first walked into the church there was this AWESOME band playing
they were ska I guess cuz they had one of those trumpet player guys
oh man
they sounded soo cool and I'm regretting not trying to find out their name
the rest of the night was cool
Met a lotta ppl
sum people I didn't wanna meet
I saw Namesake play again
they did good
I can't think of much else to say
I had my spanish regents again
one word
FAILED 2 the EXTREME
I did it to myself though
I didn't study much
I'm pretty sure i didn't pass though
anyway
thats all for now
I wanna go take a nap or sumthing
Lol, Jared you rock my crotch, as well as my heart, and mind and now even my hand is rocked by you
So, thanks to the fabulous Jared, I have two poems today *Gasps!* I ran the mile yesturday and got 6:39, not that great but not to shabby!   I really kicked my ass hard when running damn this being a flexible individaul
Hahas, it was great times
I talked to Jared's best friend Josh, he is a really nice guy, honest and funny as could be
I remind Jared of his ex
Little creepy, neh? He says it is all good, and I trust him!  So about me being more flexible I did my yoga excerises!!! *Dances happy dance*  I got to pose 157 before I was tired,and the answer is yes to all that think to ask that question, no need the answer is *stands proudly* 'yes, I can and what about you?
'  Jared may come to Virginia soon *More happy dancing*  It would make me happier than a fat child in a candy store, of he came to see me! *drools lost in my little own world, (Jared you can join me if you like)
* Ohh, where was I?  I don't reminder
well fine then to the poems
The Club Dancing to the beat, circling in the clubs Circling amidst all of these club boy dubs Wondering if there is ever one not here for sex Scribbling messages of “---- me now” into text Questioning what I am doing here and now Taking in about all the vulgarities I would ever allow Grinding against one thousand and one losers All about “He’ll suck me off,” sex-cruisers While I for that one special someone seek Turning around there is one, sexy and meek Blonde hair in the way of sparkling green eyes Small stature I shuffle over nearer after many tries Watching him, small and cute, shifting his weight Staring all the while, internally I contemplate Standing here and now like water in the candle Thoughts over him, this is all that I can handle Slowly and surely, I place myself nearer still Gazing, watching all the more, my heart slowly starts to fill I brush against him: he turns and gives an affable smile My heart soars more and more all the while We turn together and dancing, wildflowers in my mind This one guy, green eyes aglow is the one I came to find I turn and ask him with my eyes if he feels the same He tells me that the burning heart he came to tame Silent questioned answer, my waist he wraps his arm Internally more and more chimes my alarm Filled by desires, he starts to caress, releasing scents At that point I drop all of my armaments I put my arms around him, thinking all the while “yes” He reaches slowly, gently down to my chest Our hearts intertwined, knowing we are right  Slowly moving downwards, his hands slide, holding tight He reaches firmly upwards and slides his mouth to my neck Desire for each other, different then the rest, burns like heck Our hearts swell like mad, 1 a
knowing that we must part Knowing fully that we are meant to be, together one heart My number to him with my heart, and his to mine  It is true and sad, shame to have so little time But, we know that we are meant to be off of first sites And, from now until forever, no more lonely nights   Eternal Rose A simple flower, pure and true Conjuring thoughts of me and you A flower stunning, beauty anew Alluring scent drawing me towards you A striking flower, glistening with dew Shining droplets like tears for you A flower beautiful, radiating through Reminding me of the warmth of you A budding flower, like a child’s coo Creating orgasmic feelings of you A flower scintillating, for me and you Tell me you will be the one to say “I do”
Nearing the Kent State student center, there is some chatter going on, more than usual
Students were all united in a haphazard group while two people held a large red banner 'Destroy Imperialism Not Afghanistan'
Apathetic students glanced on the way to class
Apathetic curious students, like me, meandered a little closer, accepted a flyer, retreated, and pretended to read it while a guy with the black beret yelled anti-government rhetoric at your back
I stepped on sidewalk-chalked writing all the way to class, 'He hit me first, grow up America,' that was the most clever
And now, a word brought to you compliments of the  Revolutionary Communist Party, USA
(About the US gov
) We cannot be intimidated by the official and unofficial pressure to line up behind their war moves and their flags
We can see the logic of this poison in the ugly threats and beatings coming down on Arab people
As we build our resistance, we need to be crystal clear on the nature of these oppressors who are hurtling towards a new war: these arrogant lying creatures do not rule in the interests of the people of this country or the world
As long as they continue in power the horrors that come from their system will continue to rain from the sky
Keep tradition alive, call out the National Guard some students need to be shot
( in reference to the  Kent State Shootings  1970, may they rest in peace)
Can't we all just think happy thoughts? Let's all go to our happy places
Flowers, seagulls, and lollipops
What's in your happy place?
As you may remember, I wrote Delaware Governor Ruth Ann Minner an email expressing my dismay at the high infant mortality rate in our state, and asking where and how I could best help with the state's efforts to reduce this statistic
(I blogged it in ' urlLink Delaware Highest in Infant Mortality ,' 6/9/04
)  Well, she wrote me back June 18 enumerating our state's initiatives that have apparently not helped reduce infant mortality
In fact, I have taken advantage of lots of what our state offers pregnant women and new mothers and their kids, since the services are all incredible and at low cost or absolutely free
She's named an 'Infant Mortality Task Force' to assess the current status of the problem and develop strategies for improvement, including raising awareness of our state's problems
She writes:  I have alerted my staff as well as Division of Public Health staff of your interest and experience in infant mortality issues
As we move forward in development of the task force, my staff will contact you about a possible role in the task force or in the implementation of related activities
I don't have to have a role in the task force, of course, but I  would  like to know where I can be put to best use
I will visit new babies, I will stuff envelopes, I will drive pregnant women to doctor's appointments
I don't care, really, I just want to do something

Time for a quick trip through the headlines, courtesy of the  urlLink Pacific Daily News :    urlLink Gas prices rise  - citing their usual excuse (huh, gas prices rose in Singapore'), Shell bumped the price of regular up 4� a gallon

Yesterday was a great day
Food was on plan and CLEAN
I did a short but intense upper body workout and even managed to keep my diet soda intake to a 'reasonable' level
I'm looking forward to another clean day today
My lunches are packed and ready for when hunger strikes! The only possible stumbling block is that SOMEONE brought in chirstmas candy! What WERE they thinking!? But I'm having no cravings and walking past it a few times has produces NO twinges
One MAJOR alteration in my thinking this challenge is that - due to my irratic workout schedule, I'm not going to eat as if I AM working out
Instead I'm going to go lighter throughout the day and if I manage to workout, add an extra shake at the end of the day
We'll see how it goes over the next few weeks
The plan tonight is to get off early and hopefully get a run in before it gets too dark
If that doesn't happen then it will be a nice quiet evening with Billy Blanks
In eather case, I'm planning to do some Pilates as I've found that really makes my feel GREAT afterwords and does wonder for my posture
I'll leave you with this insite from a friend of mine
'I had a moment yesterday where I just wanted to say 'forget it, this is too hard' but then I knew I'd be so disappointed in myself and besides, on the scale of things, this isn't that hard
Getting a divorce is hard, letting go of a loved one is hard, giving up an addiction is hard
but honoring and respecting your body by feeding it well and making it a fit machine is simply conforming to nature

As Anita mentioned, we did indeed get quite a bit done today
I felt good about getting the content on a page done, and many of the images for half of a new site
Not to mention working together with Anita to get a set up for articles working the way we wanted to, so that she could work on getting article pages done
As always it was a challenge with the kids, as they were either getting in trouble or asking me for something the entire day
Normal, but stressful none the less
I've been strongly concidering taking them to a sitter once a week, just so I get a little peace and quiet
Only problem is it would require me to drive 10 minutes to the next town, 10 minutes getting them in and settled down (plus idle chit chat with my aunt), and another 10 minutes home
That's a half hour gone already, then another half hour going back over to get them
1 hour total
Well, not really worth it I don't think, unless I can talk my mom into at least taking them over there when she's done at the store
THAT might be worth it, but still something I need to think about (and talk my mom into)
Aside from the stress of the children, I've felt I've had a really great day
I've struggled with motivation issues for nearly 2 months now, and today was the first day I really felt I've gotten over that
Well, proof positive - it's now 8pm and I'm STILL HERE at the computer brainstorming and doing things I know need to get done instead of saying 'eh, tomorrow
I can barely keep all the ideas in my head I'm so excited
Although my online game is calling me, and I feel the need to relax a little bit after this busy day
I think I've deserved it :)   ~Kara

Welcome to my first blog posting
Let me begin with the obvious question
Who am I?  An avid electronic music fan and internet radio dj
urlLink Daft Monk's Boombox  is my station and I invite you to check it out
Beyond that I spend time on the  urlLink Synthpop
net  (where I also do occasional reviews),  urlLink Electro Culture  , and  urlLink SlothRadio  forums
I also run the  urlLink ElectroPop  group on urlLink Audioscrobbler

this, the others did not know what the faeries were on about, for only the faeries could see into other universe's
The others looked baffled and then returned to help Rob whose speach about tree's being used on boats had prompted the tree who was the captain of the boat to attack Rob with all his might
Bad for Rob that he had offended a whomping willow who was now trying to make Rob a wheeping willow
All seemed lost as Rob's dress was torn and his make up smudged, he had even resulted to cat fighting as the others took a break to watch and have a laugh and a coke (well it was 11
Once this sacred time of coke drinking was over they considered how to stop the fight so they could get on with their mission
Suddenly the little dog that had been given to Rob
urlLink        urlLink which children's storybook character are you?   this quiz was made by  urlLink colleen
Come to  urlLink   Kenya   !   I'm sorry, but this was too darn funny to pass up   Now back to the Chronicles of the Penitent
yo, yo, yo homeslices!
I want to be more than I am
I don't want to be bitter anymore
I'm so tired of wishing people would grow up
Tired of people throwing their temper tantrums and drama fits and wanting me to be someone I'm not
I don't give a shit that you're having a busy day, I'm sorry but I just don't believe that gives you the right to treat me like shit
More and more I feel the distance of those younger than me and I wonder what was so different about my life that made me grow up so fast
Sometimes I don't want to grow up
I wish that I could just worry about what my hair looked like and what clothes I wore instead of what bills I was going to pay and my future
I wonder when I'm ever going to be able to own a house with CJ
I wonder how we're going to pay at $10k debt from his school loans that I shouldn't even be responsible for
That was years before he met me and dammit he probably should have taken care of that long ago
What do I know?  I know that I have to deal with these things because there is no changing the past
I've come to terms with that
Now the real question is how do I get enough money to pay that back, get a new car and eventually buy a house
Usually you dig your own hole and bury yourself in it only to have to dig back out
Well it seems like someone else dug my hole and threw me in it
Now I'm scrambling to get out but have no idea how to
Which way is up?    Of course I made mistakes with my own money
If I had been smart I would have started saving when I started working at 15 - but I was only a kid and yearned for the things my parents never gave me
I don't ever want to hear about someone's life being so hard when they don't have a car payment or an insurance payment
Don't get me wrong, I understand that situations are different
Grass is always greener on the otherside and all that nice bullshit
but I still have the right to not want to deal with others complaining of it, don't I?   I'm tired of people I work with bitching about things at work; I tell them how they could fix whatever is wrong and they don't care
How can you continue to work in a miserable enviroment when the solution is given to you?  It makes me want to smack those people and say 'If you won't fix it then shut the fuck up!' and leave it at that
I hardly ever speak of work anymore
People ask me how works been and I say 'Sucks as usual' or 'busy as always' or something to that effect
If you catch me at the moment when someone has pissed me off, sure I'll go off and tell you what just happened
But for the most part, what does it matter to the other person?  It doesn't
Why don't people offer solutions anymore?  You tell someone about something that's wrong and they say 'oh that sucks' or just sit there and nod their heads
And yet when you tell someone about something where you just want to get it off your chest, they want to give you a million solutions to your problem
That always cracks me up
So I've just stopped talking to people about my problems in general
Do you see what I mean about not wanting to be so bitter anymore?  How does one start over?  Is there a reset switch on life that no one has shown me yet?  If I poke myself in my left eye really hard and stick my finger up my nose at the same time will it hit that special reset button and start me over?   Monday I start my diet over and I'm actually buying sneakers so CJ & I can go walking
I'm going to start exercising in the morning again and sticking to my meal plan
I haven't completely fallen off the wagon but I've relaxed too much to where I lost 5 lbs and that's all
and that's all it'll ever be if I don't start doing something about it
I actually wrote a little time schedule out for myself so that I knew I had enough time to do everything and still get to work on time (for the morning stuff)
And I have the evening planned out as well as far as when I eat and when I walk
I do realize that I am depressed
I do not need a psychologist or psychiatrist to tell me that
I am so fully aware of it that it's frightening
I watch my moods swing and wonder if I'm truly insane
It's all relative anyhow
Sometimes I miss who I used to be
Othertimes I realize what an idiot I was back then
Then I understand that I started to make a transition and just got lost along the way
I will rediscover myself
I will be pretty
I'm not striving for gorgeous or beautiful even, I just want to be pretty
I used to be so thin and took it for granted
I used to have clear skin and took that for granted as well
Now the outside matches the inside and karma has truly fucked me
Thank you karma, I had a lovely time
I'll be better
some day soon I hope
It all has to start somewhere and I know that somewhere is me
See I can get it all together, I know how
Now the only thing I have to get is M O T I V A T I O N and it will be mine
I'm here in Nashville with Dave *(this is Asher writing)
We agree that, regardless of burner accessibility, coordination, and/or speech impairment, tardiness on CDs is unacceptable
If you got flat feet, you can't be in the army
(Or a wooden eye, says Dave
) ?  Also, Dave has chronic body odor
This is a great quote i just heard
'It's nothing personal
It's just music
Woodall, 2003, in conversation (referring to his own brother's dilinquency)
Here I am again
Capitalizing and punctuating, trying to create some semblance of order in my life
(There is none
)  Have you ever noticed that the more you want something, the more unavailable it becomes?  And that what you don't want is so tangible you just want to strangle it and make it go away
Okay, so that was (a little) over the top
But I feel so
I can't explain
Surrounded, confounded, emotionally dumbfounded
Right now I want so many things at once and I can't identify anything
Everything is bleeding together
undefined   kind of like me
I don't even know who I am anymore
I never would have imagined myself this way
And yet somehow I'm strangely comfortable in this skin
*Ranting
*  I don't know what else to say
I feel like I could write for hours on empty words and meaningless cliches
But once I start I know I won't be able to stop
to the one i'm singing for: 'you drained my heart
and made a spade
Gosh, I remember JNCO's
4th grade, had to get me a pair, couldn't afford it, I was a very sad little boy
I remember them having innovative tee-shirts too
Amazing how everything changes, since I don't think any of us would go near JNCO's now
Are they even still around?  I think your skyview votes for the vote idea is very innovative, it's the kind of idealistic idea I'd expect to read about in Newsweek or something
Oh the possibilities
Is anybody else having trouble focusing their energy
We have work in this class, clarks(somewhat), and my math class
But everything else, especially my 3rd and 4th periods, are nothing
It's really hard to keep a work minded mind not having to do any work
I love summer, but I hate the mindless feeling I get from it
I always like to have my energy focused on something
I think I'm going to end up being one of those guys who can't bring themselves to retire, and when they have to they hate it and go back to work after 8 months
Closing note, Ma$e- bling bling- is back
Everyone needs to go listen to 'Welcome Back', who else can you see sampling the welcome back kotter song?  It's actually very good, and he hasn't given up on his preaching, which is cool
But it's definately a break from the all the mindless club music I hear all the time now
We're going to be moving
There are now a million things we'll need to take care of
Geologist's report, flood insurance, movers, packing, unpacking
but all that is in the future
Right now, this minute, we are just happy
No more uncertainty about the offer, no more waiting and wondering
We know
We're going to be paying rent to the bank, now, instead of to the landlord
And we got the house!
caution, bad karma ahead

Friday night and I'm stuck at home
There's a basketball game tonight, but my mom doesn't think I should go because of the weather
It is very very cold outside and the roads are all slick and snowy, so maybe it's a good idea
It was alittle hard for me to get home today after school because the hill wasn't plowed or anything and it was very scary
I thought I wasn't going to make it, but I did (going only 10 mph by the time I got to the top)
Tomorrow I have to get up very early, and I'm not looking forward to it, but when I get back Micki will be home
WOO HOO
I was supposed to try out for the musical tonight, but tryouts tonight were postponed to sometime next week
It is called 'Honk' and it's some silly play
Not many of my friends are trying out, I think Kayla is the only one
It should still be fun though

oh and for all u potter fans out there
the teaser trailer is at  urlLink the harry potter website
i just cant stand it anymore
i duno
i dont really quit boys
im just not ready to get heartbroken again
like paul himmelstien wants to go out with him
and like hes suuuuuch a cool guy
but like im just not ready to cry over a guy again
like seriously
ahh i dont even know how to explain it
driving me insane in the membrane
hopefully when i think of the words  to describe my feelings ill type them in
but unfortunatly i cant so its just gona have to wait
its scary when people you know discuss your life
i dont know
while i am totally ok with this, to a point, it is freaking my shit out
when one really really good friend accuses another good friend of knowing more about whats going on in my head it makes you wonder what you are telling whom at all times and who it is going to get back to
make sense? it concerns me that the person who does indeed know the most about my recent history is taking off soon-- for good
thinking about it sends a very ulcer-like feeling through my body
that is NOT good
i need to learn to not depend on peoples presence so much
it takes a lot for me to let someone in, and when they are there i expect it to be for the long haul
i dont want it to seem like i am a commitment freak, but i like structure
guarantees
if i invest time and energy into someone, share shit i otherwise wouldnt, learn to care about them, i want to know they will be around awhile
i guess in this case i knew they were leaving
but i had no intentions of developing the feelings inwhich i did, either
so it goes
so it goes
its 7:15 a fucking im sitting here thinking on this? course
seems its all i have done over the last few days
killing me softly
i ill haveto snap out of it soon though, i guess
now on: wilco: what is war
ok guys im so sorry i put in the same thing twice cuz i wasnt sure if it got in there the first time
ok im done typing these things
i have too many in here

Weapons of Crash Induction      Current Song: 'Loverman,' Metallica (Been a while since they showed up here
)   Current Mood: Excited     ROOTERS -- At approximately 9:30PM EST on February 11, 2004, the assault began on the dictator, Error the Fifty-Second
President Carnahan gave a propagandous rally speech before the event
'The preparations have begun in our attack on Error,' he began, invoking resounding applause
'Our troops will raid the swamp
They will find Error
They will annihilate on sight
This is not a test
'  The operation's treasurer, known anonymously as 'Reno,' finished paying off his debt to the operation's commander, also known anonymously as 'New Rising Sun
'  After the transaction was complete, the commander began his ambush on the unprepared Error the Fifty-Second
At the time of writing, Error is in exile
His land now occupied by the Forces of Good, he can only manifest where he is unexpected
Sources say that Error the Fifty-Second had many sub-errors, lurking in such places as the slippery slope and near the wraiths
Commander Sun is confident that the sub-errors will be brought to great justice
Minutes after the launch, President Carnahan claimed that 'A full solution to the evil, vile, wretched beast that is Error 52 is at hand
'  ---  Amazing, no? An actual news story
Very interesting
New look
new feel
cleared tag board
pot green what could be better?
UN ROLE IN IRAQ  I'm looking into the different proposals for a UN role in Iraq, which the Wolfowitz-types oppose
According to the BBC, President Bush has said that there is a  urlLink false choice  being created regarding who will run Iraq after the war - coalition forces or the UN
Bush says the Iraqi people will govern their country
Well, that's very nice to say, but I doubt he means to allow the country to descend into looting and violence urlLink  like that in Basra   now that the British have removed the fedayeen
Somehow, order will have to be established, and that will not be done by 'the Iraqis
'  It will be done  on their behalf , no doubt, but not by the Iraqis
The people will have to be fed, and this will not be done by Iraqis
A governance arrangement will have to be made, and this will not happen of its own accord
The UN could add some credibility in the world's eyes
This is probably because of the distaste the Bush Administration and conservatives have for the UN
I mean, last night Bob Novak was saying that allowing the UN to run things was the same as letting France run things
Now that's complete B
, but conservatives buy into that
Here's my take: the UN should be able to do some things within its expertise
But for all my love of the UN, it may be a good time to teach the UN a lesson
If the US is involved in a conflict and the UN can't do as good a job at solving a particular problem as the US can, tough luck UN
Make the UN compete for work and learn that not being effective will only get them excluded from reconstruction efforts
I think the UN needs to really be focused on humanitarian efforts and reconstruction aid and stay away from the political parts of this reconstruction effort
UN involvement may be useful in the political realm if it is facilitative of a good choice of a national leader, but, as was the case in Afghanistan, the locals, coached by the U
, need to make the choices if the U
going to have to back up this new regime
I'll reconsider my support of U
control of governance, defense, policing and other similar issues if the U
tries to install Ahmed Chalabi as the leader of a free Iraq
That guy is a useless blowhard with no local support
If he's put in power, it will only create instability in the country and he'll be gone within a few years, if not months
What the country needs is local leadership, from among the people who've suffered under Saddam
Rabbit, Run   Hey Glee - you offer hope to us old men everywhere!  To play our game, you just come up with a Movie Title that starts with the same letter the last one ended in
Net posted 'THIRTEENTH FLOOR', which ends in 'R', so I'm posting 'RABBIT, RUN', which starts with R
At least I think it was a movie

Denise Howell of  urlLink Bag and Baggage  fame recently had a very  urlLink interesting article  on  urlLink Law
com  about blogging ongoing trials
She discusses how blogging trials can be an effective alternate media outlet that is controlled by the client, attorneys, and if the client is really rich (like Martha Swewart style) then also the public relations people
She also warns that there are major pitfalls to blogging a trial
It is truly a facinating endeavor
In the article Denise interviews several hot-stuff attorneys about their experiences with blogging trials
One of these is New York attorney Robert G
Morvillo, who recently defended Martha Stewart
He came to one of my ethics classes at Cardozo and spoke to us about the Stewart defense
I remember him discussing the blog and how useful it had been to get their infomation and spin out there into the media
The lawyers interviewed say it costs a load to have a trial blogged
It got me to thinking, any lawyers who want their trial blogged I'll set up a nice looking site for you and put your posts up at a cut rate price compared to those other guys! Hell, I do all this for nada already
Anyway, go read  urlLink Denise's article , it's great stuff
HAPPY HALLOWEEN!  1
Do you usually dress up for Halloween?     Sometimes  2
Do you attend any Halloween costume parties or contests?     No! I would if I knew of any
How much, if any, Halloween decorations do you put up in your house or yard?     Very little
Just the couple of ghosts and pumpkins       my son has made at childcare
I'm sure my home will      be filled with holiday decorations in the coming      years
Do you pass out tricks or treats? If yes, do many trick or treaters stop by your house?     I do
This is my first house so I'll find out soon
Lived     in an apartment and before that with parents
Plenty     of children went trick or treating in that area

Ok, they're gone
Yup, that's right, I haven't had the nails a week before I removed them
After telling my parents that I went for a nail job, to which they went, 'You did  what ?', I waited an entire week before removing them from my fingernails
My Mom looked at them, told me which ones looked really fake, and then watched in mock horror as I began the arduous process of picking them off one by one
Suffice to say, I would try to casually 'pop' them off, and she'd be wincing watching me
Now my own nails are really rough
I have to 'buff' my nails

had a great day today! got a lot of ppl to sign my yrbook, got 3 phone #'s from some gals who want me to call them and get together this summer, muhaha ;) great stuff
took a test in 1st block, got out of it for a few minutes for an assembly about senior pictures
(*makes mental note to show that flier to parents*) got to sit with adam s
, josh, peter, russ and jacob, don't normally get to talk to all them
the best part about today?  I PASSED ALL MY GRADUATION TESTS AND PASSED WITH DISTINCTION ON 2 OUT OF 4!!!  *phew* i was worried that maybe i hadn't done well on them, but i was proved wrong
talayna was so happy, we both did really well, she sat beside me and we talked and she was literally bouncing in her chair
(she was one of the gals who left their #'s ;)) i feel sorry for those seniors who didn't pass some of their tests, they don't get to graduate :(
we have to take them as juniors, in case we fail one, so we take them again as seniors
as long as i pass all my classes next year - which i will of course - i'm set to go for graduation!  anyways, the rest of the day pretty much rocked, 'cept for makin a 50 on a test! oops! lol well i'll post again later, but i gtg catch my friend and some ppl from his youth group on the radio

August 7, 2003Thursday  After a week of class, I’ve already been called on twice to provide “the American perspective” in class discussion
I wasn’t called on twice in my entire first year of law school
I kind of asked for it, though
Two of my three classes were not on the list the office tried to convince us were the only ones “available
”  Therefore, I’m the only international student in either class
Representing an entire country can be hard work
Then again, if George W
can do it I can, too
Actually, he probably makes it easier for me
He has to be all, “Hey!  I’m the President…I’m from Texas, where we used to execute people every 15 minutes…I know what I’m doing, because the people that worked with my Dad tell me what to do
”  That let’s me be a little more moderate and show Australians not all Americans, and especially not all Texans, are war-mongering, death penalty supporting, gun toting rednecks who can’t speak English right…er, correctly
Ana, myself, and another law exchange student went to see the new “American Pie” movie tonight
Pretty damn funny, I have to say
Well worth the $7
50 AUS ($5 US)
I highly recommend it to all of you who aren't too uptight to enjoy some really good bathroom humor
You are an angel

Although things have been tough for you recently you have still managed to hold your head up high

I guess it shows just how straight-laced I am that I  still  have no fucking clue what was in the cigar box in the 1987 anti-drug PSA where the dad confronts his kid only to learned that his son learned drug use from him, all right
It was always a silly commercial as the kid keeps trying to answer his dad but the father keeps intereupting him to shut him
Daddy was probablly doped up, though, so what are you gonna do
But, I'm still mystified by that drug paraphonalia
It looked so scary and, well, complicated
I mean, this kid didn't look like someone who was into hard drugs
Maybe a joint with friends, but what was that stuff?  Heroin?  Cocaine?  I still don't know
But, I guess I'll be doing this kind of flash-back shit a lot because VH1 will start airing their sequel to 'I Love the 80's' next week
Appropriately named, of course, 'I Love the 80's Strikes Back'
Hell, I even watched 'I Love the 70's' and I genuinely wasn't there for that
I really hope the release it on DVD, though
I love this sort of meaningless pop-culture nostalgia
Socialism   And while I'm on the subject of Usenet, the huge advantage it has is that somebody will say the things you know you think and spare you the effort of articulating them, and in some cases of, er, researching them too
I've long wanted to say something about Socialism, and lo and behold a thread sprang up on rasff about it, and these posts, uh, had bouncing me up and down on the chair
I bow to the wisdom of rasff:    Dan Goodman:   Roughly speaking, socialism means that the means of production are owned by _the people who work in that factory or business_
I believe that _in theory_, this was the law in the Soviet Union and other parts of the second Russian empire
Under socialism, there isn't supposed to _be_ a national government or even local governments
Anarcho-communists believe that this can be done immediately
In the Marxist version of socialism, there was to be an interim government which would prepare the society for full socialism
There is some evidence that Marxist-Leninist governments have not given the withering away of the State as high a priority as theory calls for
This failure has been variously attributed to Lenin, Stalin, and Russian tradition
Ken MacLeod , quoting  urlLink http://www
marxists
org/archive/morris/works/tmp/backward
htm   [
] this book, having produced a great impression on people who are really enquiring into Socialism, will be sure to be quoted as an authority for what Socialists believe, and that, therefore, it is necessary to point out that there are some Socialists who do not think that the problem of the organisation of life and necessary labour can be dealt with by a huge national centralisation, working by a kind of magic for which no one feels himself responsible; that on the contrary it will be necessary for the unit of administration to be small enough for every citizen to feel himself responsible for its details, and be interested in them; that individual men cannot shuffle off the business of life on to the shoulders of an abstraction called the State, but must deal with it in conscious association with each other
That variety of life is as much an aim of true Communism as equality of condition, and that nothing but an union of these two will bring about real freedom
That modern nationalities are mere artificial devices for the commercial war that we seek to put an end to, and will disappear with it
And, finally, that art, using that word in its widest and due signification, is not a mere adjunct of life which free and happy men can do without, but the necessary expression and indispensable instrument of human happiness
and finally and most particularly - for all those people, yes Italian comrades I'm talking to you - who think the USA are a bastion of reaction:    Michael J
Lowrey   Last night, I went to a dinner with 700 other folks, celebrating the 90th birthday of Milwaukee Socialist and ex-Mayor Frank Zeidler
The local Lutheran Bishop mentioned that when he came to Milwaukee, Frank gave him a tour of the city, and eruditely explained an enormous amount about Milwaukee history
He called his brother in the Seattle mayor's office to talk about this amazing ex-mayor he'd met, and his brother said, 'You mean Socialist Mayor Zeidler is a Lutheran?'; the Bishop said, 'You mean Lutheran Mayor Zeidler is a Socialist?'  In Milwaukee, Socialism meant a lot of the lakefront and riverbank lands were bought by the taxpayers, and made into parks, instead of incredibly expensive condos
It meant housing being built for poor people, and run by an agency responsive to the taxpayers AND the tenants
It meant a pioneering Health Department, and good sewers, when such public improvements were scorned as interference by do-gooding busybodies
It meant a world-class City Museum that was a haven for scholarship, with an extensive publishing program and even its own ethnographic and zoological expeditions to Africa and Central America
It meant Mayor Dan Hoan trying to arrange a store to sell war surplus at cost to the local citizens, with nobody profiteering
It meant a city government that kept its AAA bond rating, because the Socialists believed in pay-as-you-go government (they didn't want to mortgage the people's future to bankers)
It meant schools open to all the children without subjecting them to religious propaganda
It meant the cleanest, least corrupt government this reform-minded state has _ever_ seen in its history
It meant that when a former party leader advocated working together with the KKK because they had been so successful among working-class Americans elsewhere, the sonofabitch was expelled from the party and his vile suggestion denounced in ringing terms by then-mayor Hoan
It meant trying to make the city a better place for honest working people, rather than running around posturing about how 'revolutionary' you were (and being sneered at by the 'revolutionaries' as mere 'sewer socialists')
It meant, in Frank's own words, 'a way of life based on cooperation, rather than competition
'  --  Michael J
Lowrey proud, today in particular, to be a Milwaukee 'Sewer Socialist'
Been in Germany for three days now
Flight over here was nice, there was a tv and some movies to watch, so it went by pretty fast
I stopped in London for like four hours
Really really bored
So I just passed the time listening to my walkman
The guys that were supposed to be escorting me because I was a minor didn’t look very happy
Aparently he had better things to do
But it makes me feel special when u got a person in a suit walking with you 
Anyways I slept on the flight from London to Germany
Didn’t even get up while we were landing
So my ears hurt after I woke up
Like when I sneezed, they hurt and I was like “Jesus fucking Christ!” When I was waiting for my uncle of course
The weather changes like every hour
Im inside and I look out, and its sunny
Then I want to go out for a walk, its raining
Then we go out to buy some stuff from the supermarket, and its sunny
Pisses me off
And when people talk to me in German I have to go like “No German” and shake my head
Then they go, “Oh, you American, u Bush”
And then I either walk away or go ”No Bush”
So it gets kinda awkward
Theres no one my age around here either
Everyones either under ten or like eighteen
I mean, not like i would be able to communicate with them
We went swimming today
It was fun, there were water slides and stuff at the outside pool
Thank god it was heated
The temperature here is like fifty degrees
Really cold
But you know what I don’t get
Why cant kids go into the sauna
Seriously theres always a rule that says kids cant go there
I mean jeez, we’re not retards and going to get suffocated in there
Well, some people might
But survival of the fittest right
If you get yourself killed in the sauna, you’re just too stupid to live
Just joking
But there is nothing to do here after dinner
I could watch tv, but people yelling in a language I just don’t really understand makes me turn it off
Watched the euro cup finals though
Great match with Portugal against Greece
Dial -up connection and its going really slow
so im gone
Hi this is K_bob what's up?  urlLink Stacey's  going to show me how to link
It ought to work this time
On Sunday I had Trenton over after church and we skated and watched all the big battles on lord of the rings
On Monday I bought a roll of duct tape and made a pair of pants, and we started on Stacey's new room in the basement
If any body wants to buy a pair of pants let me know they're $5
Today I am just sitting around doing nothing
It's quite fun you ought to try it some time
Not too long ago I realized my music collection essentially sucked
Perhaps it isn't fair to say that it  completely  sucked, since there was, and still is, a good amount of quality music
Some Miles Davis mixed with some Gorillaz, Ben Folds Five wrapped around some Beatles, etc
But there was also the Michelle Branch, the Stacie Orrico, and yes, even an Ashlee Simpson tune
The problem wasn't really that I had bad taste in music, either
It simply was that the ratio of quality music to sugary, cancerous music was just too unbalanced for my comfort
Two things occured to make me realize this
One:  I read High Fidelity by Nick Hornby  Two: I bought an iPod  When you read High Fidelity, you suddenly realize that there are a lot of albums out there that you like but never bother to remember because the only people who remember some of these bands are music snobs
I am not a music snob, and if I ever were to make that claim the other music snobs would promptly kick my ass
Or at least give me the scoffing of a lifetime
But in this book, you realize that there are a lot of great bands out there that you most certainly have heard before but can never remember who they are
For example, I've heard the Beta Band so many times, yet it wasn't untill recently that I figured out who they were and that, yes, Heros for Zeros is a pretty rockin album
While reading High Fidelity I started to feel guilty, not for having no taste in music, but for ignoring some great musicians simply because MTV hadn't thrust them in my face
For shame, Andy, for shame
It made me miss college when all I would ever see were quality bands that no one had ever heard of
Guster, Dan Bern, Kris Delmhorst, I salute you
The iPod
It's amazing how suddenly your entire music collection can be criticized because you just happen to be holding it in the palm of your hand
I had been wanting an iPod pretty much since they arrived on the scene, but held off because 1) they kept releasing better versions and I was holding out for a good one and 2) (and most prominently, I might add) I couldn't afford one even if I sold both my kidneys
So with my recently getting a new job at a major wireless company, my income became slightly more padded (imagine going from wireframe bucket seats in a car to having a piece of cloth draped over the rusty springs - that's the level of padding we are talking here) enough for me to slurge on something - naturally my little music machine was top on my list
So I buy the 40Gb iPod, and though my wallet is $400 lighter, I am a thousand times happier
I proudly display my new toy to everyone
'What do you have on there?' they ask, and I gladly hand them the unit so they could bask in the glory of my collection
'Have any Nirvana?'  No
'Any Cure?' No
'Any Al Green?  Marvin Gaye?  Cream?' No, no, no
'Do you have anything good?' Well, I do have Guster
'Who?'   Damnit
See, what good is having a quality music collection if no one knows what the hell half the stuff in your collection is?  And, if the other half is sugary, overindulgant pop music, they are naturally going to assume that the first half, even though they have never heard it before, is ALSO sugary overindulgant pop music
Thus, I had become, in the eyes of my peers, a mindless slave to a catchy beat and teenage girls singing about how their boyfriends suck
I needed a fix
I mostly needed the fix because this whole realization that I came off as a musical Forrest Gump made me slightly depressed
No one is going to talk to you about music if they think you haven't got an ounce of taste in your bones
So I went to the guru, the god of musical trivia
I spoke to my little brother
Jonathan, my brother, is a sort of musician
I say sort of musician because he is really like the fruit basket of music
Jonathan samples a bit of all styles, rather than serving as a main course for any one given genre
For example, he is a bassist that plays jazz, hip-hop and funk, but he also mixes a damn fine electronic beat and dabbles in the piano
His collection ranges from the most obscure jazz musician to the best of cream, and shoots all over in betweeen
He's my go-to guy when it comes to musical advice
So Jonathan gives me a list, I start hunting around for cds from friends and family to rip and store on my precious iPod
I'm feeling good, I've gotten most of it, and now I'm feeling close to complete
So I have, essentially, revamped my life in terms of my music collection
Do you have any Cream?  Why, yes, I do
I also have Beta Band, Velvet Underground, and a smidge of Massive Attack
Would you like some Portishead to go with that?  Perhaps I come off as somewhat shallow, believing my music collection has some impact on my worth as a human being
But hey, I got a better soundtrack than most in my head when I'm walking down the street
And it's not Stayin Alive, I garuntee it
Christy and Jason's kitty

happy birthday to me!
Let us all take a moment and pay homage to my friend and yours: the cigarette
When I have a day like I just went through, I can't stop thinking about how much I loved cigarettes, and how it really wouldn't be that bad if I started smoking them again
Especially when I'm driving
For former smokers, cigarettes are like the lover you tossed out when you finally realized that he was an abusive, cheating shithead: if you go back just this once, they think that they are part of your life again - they don't stop calling, they can't take a hint, and even though the smoking was hot and just like you remember it, they leave you feeling like vomiting the next morning
How I long for the days when I was cool, when I hung out on the street corner with my sleeves rolled up and a butt hanging out of my mouth, when my words were neatly punctuated with the crisp crackle of taking a drag right in the middle of a sentence - this can be very effective if timed correctly during a serious bout of talking
Oh for the slight head spin and random leg numbing of taking that first drag of the day - pure pure pleasure
And by the way I still haven't figured out what you are supposed to do with yourself at a bar if you don't smoke
Any ideas? I want to meet random people by asking them for a lighter, really, without a cigarette this often fails
I want to bond with my co-workers and waste time by sharing umbrellas and smoking in shifts
I'm getting excited just writing about this
I want that long cylindrical stick in my mouth and I want to suck on it, ever so slightly, just enough to make the tip glow
I want it to take my breath away with it's presence, I want to flick that filter, hear my fingernail POP a bit on the end
I want to breathe in that tasty essence, visualize it filling me up on the inside, swirling, dancing in my belly
I want to roll those babies around in my fingers and smell that warmth, feel how tight it's packed, listen to the paper on my skin, yearning for my lips to wrap around this beauty, ready ready ready to go
Smooth, fire-y, crackle, mmmmm, ahhh
OH!  I still have not figured out how to deal correctly with the following: feeling nervous, needing a break, feeling sad, feeling lonely, feeling bored, being at a bar, being at a party, being around people when I'm drunk, feeling like punching your boss, being at the end of my rope, driving alone - either really happily or really desperately, or what the hell is supposed to satisfy me after eating a meal? Pie sure isn't the answer
For those of you that have never smoked, surely you must have a habit that you can equate to the ecstasy of a cigarette: jogging? eating tofu? tai bo? being Amish?  For those of you that currently smoke, I'm sorry
Pretend you never saw this post
Smoking is bad, cigarettes are bad, and you are bad for liking them
And I love you and don't want you to die
Stupidly, I thought this would help my craving go away
Now I  just want a cigarette ten times more
I'm going to 7-11 right now and by the time you read this it will be too late to stop me
Now, if only I had more than $5
Maybe next time I get paid
The sun is shining and the skies are clear now, but they weren't at 4:00 this morning
I got up, looked outside and decided it wasn't worth my time
The clouds were thick and overcast the entire sky
I will try again tomorrow morning, that is the actual climax of the Perseids
Maybe my chances will be better then
It's Alright  Dictation being forced in Afghanistan Revolution in South Africa taking a stand People in Eurasia on the brink of oppression I hope it's gonna be alright 'cause the music plays forever I hope it's gonna be alright  Forests falling at a desperate pace The earth is dying and desert taking its place People under pressure on the brink of starvation I hope it's gonna be alright  Generations will come and go but there's one thing for sure Music is our life's foundation and shall succeed all the nations to come I hope it's gonna be alright 'cause the music plays forever I hope it's gonna be alright 'Cause the music plays forever  The year three thousand may still come to pass but the music shall last I can hear it on a timeless wavelength never dissipating but giving us strength  I hope it's gonna be alright  --Pet Shop Boys
I guess today will be devoted entirely to sports headlines
I just read that Shaq has been traded to the Miami Heat for their entire roster almost, plus a first round draft pick
No I guess the focus turns back to Kobe
Barring that he isn't incarcerated, what will he do?  I'm guessing stay in LA since now that his main two rivals, Phil Jackson and Shaq, are moving out of town
I guess we will get to see if those two truly can win without each other

Today I came upon this very interesting revelation, and that is that my life is damn near pointless
It's funny how it all came about too
I was at work just doing the whole cashiering thing, and on the register next to me is this mother and and this little kid
The kid goes to the cashier next to me, 'I'm going on a date tonight!'
Then the cashier asks how old this kid is, and he responds with 'I'm six'
So I told you that story to tell you this one
I am seventeen years old, and have never had a date, let alone a girlfriend, and standing right next to me was this six year old kid that apparently has had both
I have been living this life for eleven more years than this kid and he has had more luck than I have had
Maybe it's because I'm shy or just a complete loser
Either way, I just found myself to be pathetic for those few moments
So that was the crappy part of the day
Well that was the only thing interesting that happened
So as Lloyd says to Harry in Dumb and Dumber, 'Man, You are one pathetic loser'
I will direct that same comment to myself

I got drunk and forgot to close my tab at  urlLink The Speakeasy  last night

Ummmmm, yeah
I haven't collected myself just yet
I really don't know this time, and it's bad
It's just confusion in a can or something
I'm just sitting here and I have a whole bunch of stuff around me: math packets, markers, tape, opened letters, a plate for a brownie already consumed
I wish I had Norah playing, but then again I'm too lazy to retrieve it, and it's probably nearing dinnertime
Everybody knows spring break has to end sometime
I was conscious of the fact, and always, but I didn't prepare myself
On Friday or Saturday I didn't go ok Lydia, this is it, you better get your homework in order, clean up your room, just get ready, etc
So now I'm sitting here, as I've said before, and just cramping and feeling lost
Maybe I'll do the Alamo review tonight
I don't know if we're obligated to finish the Spanish AP work since we were given all the answers
I just wish I could clean up, maybe
That'd be a healthy start

I can't sit in that math class for two hours and listen to the rules of logic that I learned the summer before ninth grade

Tic Tac Blue!  Tic Tac Blue!
My team (Roz) had our first game this morning in thesoccer tournament
We played against a Tier 5 (one level higher than us), 1st place team
In the first 5 minutes, I thought for sure we were losers, because all the girls on that team had amazing control and awesome passes
Have you ever seen the movie  The Ladybugs ?  It's about a really crappy soccer team, and I'm sure we looked like that (at first)
They scored the first goal, but then we came back with a goal
Actually, yours truly, did
*proud smile*   I had been challenging the goalie, who would come out of her net way too far, so finally, I decided to just shoot it in when she was coming out towards me
It worked
(much to my surprise)! We were tied 1-1 at half time
Then they scored another goal, but I scored another goal after that, shooting the ball into the high left corner (which surprised me again that it went in)
I'm sure the wind picked it up because I swear I saw the ball sailing in the air
Shortly after, I assisted our third goal by crossing over to the center forward, who popped it in
We were so excited that we sort of let our guards down and they came back with a vengence, scoring a minute later
back to a tie again!  Finally in the last couple minutes, Teresa (right forward) scored our 4th goal and we held it to the end
YAY! So what seemed like an iffy game turned out to be an exciting and defeating one! My team has 2 more games tomorrow
First place team gets $450
Wish us luck!

Iran's resistance of IAEA regulation is a fait accompli by Iran
Of course, why would anyone be skeptical of a fundamentalist theocracy, known to sponsor terror and take Western hostages, about their nuclesr program?  Iran is truly a problem
A stable Iraq is essential to pushing Iran toward reform and relative stability
A stable Afghanistan would help as well
I just hope the coming stability of both is not too late to prevent harm from the theocrats in Iran
How could i forget
This past weekend, Jason invited me to go with him too see his buddy Rick again
This would be a moving trip, seeing how he is moving into his new house
We get there, and there are numourus people outside, Jason and I just look at each other
We get out of the car, and the Rickster sees us
His buddy J! The smile that came over his face was fantastic
So we hopped into the crowd and helped out
Hours later we are still helping, and with amazement we are still smiling
We loved being there, it was great
Ricks new house was quite awsome
The yard has so much that you could do with it
And the house just seemed to fit them better
They had a wonderful front porch decked out with a swing
One thing  that i loved was the 2 huge car garage
The breeze was nice, as we watched Ricks kids play with their grandparents
It was a great trip, i would love to do it again
And i hope that we will
hehe Oh yea, J let me drive the HONDA all the way back to my doorstep, he rocks!
Please send me anything but signals that are mixed, cause I can't read your rolling eyes

Of course, what would a conversation about mannequins be without reference to the 80's classic of the same title?   Jonathan Switcher is a young artist
He just doesn't seem to last in any job he does
But when he builds a mannequin, he makes it so perfect, he falls in love with it
It is the first thing he has made that makes him feel like a real artist
The mannequin ends up in the window of a big department store
When he saves the life of an old lady who happens to be the owner of that store, he is rewarded by getting a job at the store as stock boy
Later the mannequin comes to life as Emmy, who was an ancient Egyptian living in the year 2514BC
The two redesign the window display to make it most eye catching in town
The store competitors are not happy and will do anything to stop them!   This plot summary brought to you by the good folks at  urlLink imdb
I know it's somewhat based on the Pygmalian myth and it's intended as a fluffy romantic comedy, but does anybody else find the idea of a grown man having a serious relationship with a lifesize doll kind of wacked?  Of course, I find most romantic comedies creepy, with the exception of 'Addicted to Love
'  (In spite of the fact that it stars Meg Ryan, the plot mainly revolves around two stalkers, for some reason I find this less yak-inducing than 'Runaway Bride
')   When I was little and I had to fill out those cute little homework assignments in first and second grade where they asked you about your favorite food and what you wanted to be when you grew up and if a magic genie gave you a wish what would you wish for I always, ALWAYS wrote that I would wish for my toys to come to life
My favorite book at the time was  Amy's Eyes  by Richard Kennedy, where a bunch of toys come to life and go on a pirate adventure in search of golden treasure
Adorable right?  But then, get this, the main character gets turned from a little girl into a doll and then her button eyes are eaten by a fish so her brother packs her in salt so she won't turn into a real girl again and go blind and then later a doll-come-to-life named Skivvy becomes convinced the apocalypse is at hand and sabotages the ship
I was like 9 when I read that
I thought it was so awesome
I wanted all my stuffed animals to come to life and go to school with me and then we could all go kick ass on the people who made fun of me on the bus
Oh, please, we were all frequently horrible as children
I just kept a detailed journal of it
Er, tangent, apologies
Anyway, if the mannequins at the mall now came to life, no chance of inappropriate relations with window-dressers, as none of the mannequins have heads and most don't even have arms that go all the way out
Just some headless zombie mannequin army
What would they do, I wonder?  I don't envision them rampaging around, smashing windows and terrorizing consumers
I kind of see them going down to KayBee and playing with the wind-up doggies, or going into other stores and trying on entirely different wardrobes, or hanging out in the massage chair at the Gadget Porn store, or curling up on the leather couches in Pottery Barn, finally able to rest after all that standing
Happy 4th of July!!  I especially want to wish our friend Jeremy who is in Baghdad right now searching for insurgents &  urlLink Blackjack , of course, because he's in Iraq, too
What did yall do for the 4th?  Chris-the-Great & I went down to Astoria Park here in Queens
We layed out for a while and played frisbie & threw the football back and forth
Then we walked along the water toward Hoyt Avenue
We stopped at one spot underneath the Triboro Bridge and when the waves washed ashore, you could hear the water going over all of the glass
It made a tinkling sound
There was so much trash and garbage washed up it was pretty nasty
Hope everyone has had a good weekend and if you're off tomorrow, drink a beer for me!
I did go to Venice, but I think I was in Milan when I was attacked by pigeons
I never did get a copy of that picture, though I'd still love to have one
Too bad I screwed things up so badly with Jess
Also too bad she's not the forgive-and-forget type
If anyone goes to Venice, they have have to bring me back one of the little stained glass necklaces
I'll pay you back, of course
I should have gotten one when I was there
That and one of the little glass bags with a glass goldfish
And you have to go see Santa Lucia
I still say the Catholics are weird for not burying their saints
Then again, that's kind of part of being a saint
You can't offend anybody even after you die, and since society hates a rotting corpse
Switzerland is gorgeous
It's very clean and very proper and the people are very polite and helpful
In Italy, you're family to everyone you meet
We got to Milan late one night and we went to this hotel that was recommended by the 'Let's Go Europe' (which you should definitely invest in if you're going to be travelling there)
Well, it was full, but the guy got on the phone and called his brother-in-law who had a hotel on the next block so we went and stayed with him and got a deal on the rooms because we knew someone in his family
It was great!  And the guy who owned the hotel we were staying in gave us a Christmas bread thingy that we ate for breakfast for the next three days
We have them here now, too, but I can't remember what the bread is called
Oh, and we wanted to find a wine shop so we asked him if he knew where one was and he said that if he'd known we wanted wine, he would have brought us some from his family vineyard in Tuscany
The Italians and the Irish both take you in and take care of you like family, so those are great places to visit
Oh, and if you wanted to go to Ireland, let me know and I'll talk to my cousin about getting a couple of maps of some of the cities that will let you know where not to go if you want to make it to your return flight
Abby is going to be student teaching over there next spring for about 10 weeks and they are giving the kids all kinds of useful survival information
And truthfully, while I loved Italy, I'm going to have to say that Scotland was my favorite
Yes, I'm completely biased and am quite proud of my Scots heritage, but I think I had the most fun there with Cara and Steph and Jen
It was beautiful and interesting and a few people wore kilts and had great accents and the castle is built on an extinct volcano
A volcano

He is planning on watching the re-run of the&nbsp;pilot episode of 'Stargate Atlantis' I like the show ('Stargate Atlantis') and think that it will be on for a long time
I have a slight headache that has pretty much lasted all day
I took some Excedrin (sp?), but it has not kicked in yet
I think I will take more pain killers in a little while to try and get rid of this headache
I hate it when I get headaches because they seem to be tenacious bastards that don't want to go away
I stopped by Bridgeway today to pick up a re-fill on the meds prescribed to help me sleep
So far they have worked great, but unfortunately if I get woken up during the night I am awake for the rest of the night
I may need a higher dosage, but I don't want to risk the side effects
Today and last night the guinea pigs were mating like crazy
I don't yet know what we are going to do with the babies (if they have babies), but I am sure we'll figure something out :O) Perhaps we can sell them or even give them away free
We still have to name them still
I have been considering some names, but as of right now nothing is definate
Well, thats all for today

I was trying to figure out the whole RSS feed stuff and have now made my blog not only starving for any sort of RSS, but also it is now sans bubbles
I would make one terrible programmer
To further exacerbate my disgust with my current physical surroundings (in keeping with my disgust for my internet surroundings - namely my blog, see above), my very short and very cute tree in the back yard that my father gave me from one of  urlLink those  catalogs is apparently now The Love Shack for all the Japanese beetles in the neighborhood
It's a  urlLink fruit cocktail tree  and none of the catalogs show it in picture form
only in drawing form, which leads me to think that perhaps none of them make it to adulthood or something
they don't live long enough to be photographed in any form other than sticks, maybe?  Anyway, I discovered the new purpose of my tree (Hang Out for Beetles with One Thing on Their Beetly Mind) when I glanced at the tree and saw a few plums turning a nice shade of purple out there
At the rate that tree and the beetles are going, I can only figure that getting their mack on makes for a really hungry beetle
Oh, and there's one voyeur wasp out there, hanging onto the one overripe plum, smoking a cigarette and taking pictures

My hairdresser sent me an e-mail today from rehab in Arizona
He discovered by blog in a search online
He writes that he is doing well but is innundated with affirmations and sing alongs
He also notes that he is one of six hairdresser in the facility
Isn't that funny? He writes, 'Everyday, someone always reads that poem about the footprints where some guy is walking on a cliff and there's like 2 sets of footprints
and then this guy gets to a really steep part, and when he looks back one of the sets is gone
And he goes, 'oh, my father, why did you forsake me in my time of need?' and God says 'Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, I was carrying you, don't you see? I hate this poem
Please make it stop!!' I have no idea what he is talking about but it sounds funny
I guess you have to know my hairdresser
I have been with him for 9 years now
He is from Berlin and tells me now that his life as 'The King of the Pah-tay' is over
He'll always be the King of my hair

Yesh, Listne to Nicki, BLOG
I hope to update this page more or less daily with whatever takes my fancy at the time
Partly, it's so I don't forget what I've been doing
But it's OK for you to read as well, if you really,  really  want to
On the right, you can see some links I've created to pages I find useful or interesting
I am a serial blogger; I think this is the third I've attempted to keep, but the others have failed (obviously)
With a bit of luck I will manage to write something interesting here, now and then, but don't hold your breath
This blog is intended to complement my website proper, which can be found  urlLink here
At this moment in time, there's nothing there, but there will be soon, so you'd better bookmark it, OK?
I've pirated myself some great music this very evening
Why, it's so good, that if the RIAA troopers kicked down my door, beat the shit out of me, and locked me away in Atomic Fusion State Penitentiary, in the center of The Sun, it would still have been worth it
Well, maybe the new Modest Mouse album isn't  that  good, but it's close
It's a lot smoother than their previous stuff, and I really dig that
It's like it has been polished with a soft rag while secretly drugged and 'reconditioned'
I'm also about to burn some CDs for Molly, namely the four Pixies albums I own, and a copy of 'Good news for people who love bad news'
It's great to know that I can deliver so much entertainment at no cost to myself
It's as if CD-Rs grow on trees in my house
Magical trees in my green-house
Already made the plan
When I turn 17, I'm going to get my restricted license
I'm then going to install a mount for my iPod on my dashboard
Allowing me the massive pleasure of driving around listening to great music
Step three consists of asking Molly if she'd like a ride
Then I (or we) drive head first away from South Orange
We'll live off the land and music, making our way westward
Eventually I reckon we'd have to rob a hip record store to refill
Step five, push my car off the coast and watch it accordian on the rocks below
Step six is the most important, because it's a mystery
Even though I said I would work on some Heartsmackingz, it never happened, and probably won't for a while
As the end of school and our summer show draw nearer every day band practice and homework seem to be sucking my free-time dry
If you looked inside my chest you would find a small dried raisin titled 'joy and lollygagging'
At least the KP  practicing is paying off
We perfected a hot and mysterious song today, and it was really a blast to perform
I just hope we can learn the rest of our designated covers come  urlLink June 12th
This show seems extra important to me, simply because of the inherent visibility
It makes me so proud that people living next to or even near to Flood's Hill have no choice but to be rocked

I came home after making a brief fact-finding mission to Great Yarmouth District Library to look up info on how to write the perfect C
V (or at least one that will allow me to make it to the interview stage) only to witness the familiar site of my dearest father, completely off his face trying to cook tea
Considering his level of intoxication (pretty high but not off the Captain Josh scale) he didn't make such a bad job of frying sausages and mashing potatoes
No-one was maimed or injured (at least not this time) and the fire alarm didn't go off once
Perhaps that's because Mum took the battery out but let's just overlook that minor detail shall we?  Sylvia finally got in contact with the parents last night which is good as it has earned me a significant amount of Big Sister brownie points: Dad assumes that the impetus for Sylv to get back in touch came from me which is not entirely true
I always think the best policy is for me not to nag at her to 'do the right thing' (whatever that is) and in fairness I can completely understand why she felt/feels resentful towards them
I think Sylvia wanted to go to university but couldn't hack living here while she did her A-levels and thus came to the logical conclusion that getting a job would be the quickest way for her to get her independence
And Sylvia is highly motivated by cashola, which is why she is fast climbing the corporate ladder and I am languishing in the family home trying to work out what direction to go in
Today I tried to break the back of my second graduate application
This time I'm going for a publishing job at Oxford University Press in their EFL department
I've never been all that interested in publishing before (don't worry guys, I didn't put that on the application form) but I have always had a slightly geeky obsession with English Language coursebooks and I would geninuely like to get involved with producing them
Anyway, I spent the best part of the afternoon banging out a covering letter
I'm worried that if I'm not careful I'll come across as a bit of a brain on a stick, as the 'extra-curricular activities' that I need to beef up my experience and make me seem like a more well-rounded human being consist of having written two articles for Varsity and sitting in on English Faculty meetings as student rep
Hardly impressive
I also need to avoid repeating the words 'teaching', 'effective' and 'materials' if Oxford University Press are truly to believe that I have a 'keen I four detail'
That's a joke
Go on laugh, it'll add years onto your life expectancy
So what did I spend all my time at university doing?  Down the pub?  No, sadly not
Leading an exciting double life?  No, wasn't that either
My 'extra-curricular activity', I'm sad to say, was Having A Boyfriend
Until my fateful final year, I allowed having a boyfriend to fill up most of the extra time I had when I wasn't poring over the Collected Works of Lancelot Andrewes, a little known 17th century sermon writer with a peculiar proclivity for punning in the pulpit
Haven't heard of him?  Good for you
Bet your uni had a student union where the floor had a healthy covering of stale beer and vomit and a selection of highly toxic beverages which could be purchased for a mere one of her Majesty's english pounds
My friend, you have spent your precious youth profitably
I salute you!  Ahem
No, having a boyfriend was seconded only by my other major extra-curricular activity, moaning
Moaning, whingeing, whining, ranting, complaining, navel gazing
As you can see, this pastime took on multitudinous forms and why, with the right combination of Co-Op Lemon Cake, hot beverages and good company a decent session could quite easily last the entire afternoon
Christ, why did I waste so much time complaining about how much sodding work I had to do rather than just getting on with it?!?  Perhaps I am more French than I would like to admit (if you're reading this Emilie, I'm really sorry
'Bon, bah, ce n'est pas ma fault, madame, il faut voir a cote, je ne peux rien faire, on dejeune, ce n'est pas evident
'  I HATE THAT FUCKING PHRASE!!!  'Ce n'est pas evident', literally translates as 'It's not obvious' but what it really means is, 'I dunno love, whaddya want me to do about it, I'm a grade A jobsworth and je regrette que I just can't be arsed
'  Phew, that was a bit of a rant, wasn't it?  It seems to come so naturally to me that it might be worth whacking down on the 'Hobbies and Other Interests' section of my C
V after all
Perhaps I've been exaggerating a little, but I do regret not getting involved with more extra curricular activities while I was at uni, particularly journalism
I don't mean 'journalism' in the grand sense of the term, but I think it would have been good for me to put pen to paper in a non-academic context more often and motivating to see the results in print
A girl I did English with who shall remain unnamed spent all her time in the first year at Varsity
She then spent much of the long vac and Michaelmas term setting up a rival student paper because she felt good old Varsity was too tabloid-y
Now I remember feeling very smug about all this because this certain person was regularly being threatened with being kicked out of Cambridge as she's done so little work while pious little me had spent all this time virtuously digging out obscure journals in the University Library and learning my translation of Gawain and his sodding Green Knight off by heart
The upshot of all this is that Zoe is now at Harvard while I made myself ill with work-related anxiety and ended up with a 2:2
Not that I'm being hard on myself
I'm just sad that I focused on the wrong things and never fully appreciated that there was more to being at university than being a good girl and handing in all my work on time
Of course we all have regrets in life, I suppose the key thing is to learn from them
So, I'm writing, right here, right now, for my own little select audience and that's something: more than something, a concrete step in the right direction
I Love the 90's
But I'll Love It More Now    Oh my goodness gracious, will you look at that?! YAY! I Love the 90's starts on July 12 and I for one can hardly contain myself
I watched I Love the 80's like an idiot watches grass grow
Awesome stuff
Only this time I can remember crap
Hal Sparks, Michael Ian Black, Rachael Harris, and the rest of the crew are comin' back, and I can't wait to laugh my ass off
*grins*    In Other News    THE BEASTIE BOYS RETURN!  Sha-zam-an'-abra-kadabra!    Featured Music Videos    'Breaking the Habit' by Linkin Park   Okay, if you haven't seen the latest video from Lnkin Park, then I suggest you go to Yahoo Launch or something to see it, because it's just better
I loved this video for a number of reasons
I am a huge, huge Linkin Park fan and have been from the very start
It's anime-like
I like Japanese anime and Americanized anime
It's all in the beauty of the artwork, and yes---the angst of the characters and the storyline
Who doesn't want to see Inuyasha cream his enemies, Tsukasa struggle to remember his purpose in the World, or robots kick the shit out of each other?   3
Th lyrics are very inspiring
More on that in a minute
The rough yet graceful textures of dark-filled emotion pop out at you
You almost need to hear the song, but once you read the lyrics, the anime video and the song form in your head
This song is cryptic to me, as are most Linkin Park songs that I can name off (and that's all of them)
Breaking the Habit, to me, is the story of a person who has their troubles constantly from some habit---whatever it may be---and they knkow if they don't stop, it will tear them apart
That is to say, slowly destroy or kill them
They try to break the habit, but it gets the better of them
Finally, after much trama, they vow to break the habit tonight
Anyway, the lyrics go like this:   'Memories consume  Like opening the wound  I'm picking me apart again  You all assume  I'm safe here in my room  Unless I try to start again   I don't want to be the one  The battles always choose  'cause inside I realize  That I'm the one confused   I don't know what's worth fighting for  Or why I have to scream  I don't know why I instigate  And say what I don't mean  I don't know how I got this way  I know it's not alright  So I'm  Breaking the habit  I'm breaking the habit  Tonight   Clutching my cure  I thightly lock the door  I try to catch my breath again  I hurt much more  Than any time before  I had no options left again   I don't want to be the one  The battles always choose  'cause inside I realize  That I'm the one confused   I don't know what's worth fighting for  Or why I have to scream  I don't know why I instigate  And say what I don't mean  I don't know how I got this way  I know it's not alright  So I'm  Breaking the habit  I'm breaking the habit  Tonight   I'll paint it on the walls  'cause I'm the one at fault  I'll never fight again  And this is how it ends   I don't know what's worth fighting for  Or why I have to scream  But now I have some clarity  To show you what I mean  I don't know how I got this way  I know it's not alright  So I'm  Breaking the habit  I'm breaking the habit  I'm breaking the habit  Tonight   After you see/hear the music video, it's no wonder why it took six long years before the band felt anything could do it justice
The video reminds me of the future---possibly the pressent---just shown as darker
Finally, after some interestingly portrayed anime angst, we see our very own Linkin Park peeps---lead vocalist Chester Bennington (I have a MAD crush on him!!); vocalist, emcee, and sampler (plus other stuff) Mike Shinoda; along with Phoenix the bassist; Rob Bourdon the percussionist; Mr
Hahn the recorder and sampler (put Mike and Mr
Hahn together and you have *KA-CHING* MUSIC BLING AND PRETTY SOUNDS); and Brad Delson the guitarist
They are anime-ed and are singing/playing the song on top of a building, it looks like
Very nice finishing touch, and then the last thing you see is that cool
spinning thing
you have to see it
All in all, it was a wonderfully done video
I can't wait for their next album, and I sit here wishing I could see them on their Projekt Revolution tour
In the meantime I faithfully bang my head to each and every one of their songs in my CD player
Linkin Park is truly the hot shit
'So Cold' by Breaking Benjamin   Believe it or not, this is the first song I have heard from Breaking Benjamin, and I've got less to say on it, but all together I loved the darkness of hte video and song and I can't help but wonder if there is something subliminal about the video/song
Anyway, the song sounds both angry and dramatic
It looks as if the young man is carrying the 'concrete block' as a punishment for something he did
It also looks like it's chained to him, so he can't get away from it, even if he tried
Older people are following him
Maybe they are family, for they looked sorrowful
Now, to me, I couldn't quite tell what these people were; they all were dressed up in black and in a certain way
I would have guessed Amish or Jewish because mostly all of them had dark hair, but if they aren't, and you happen to be Amish or Jewish, DO NOT TAKE OFFENSE and please DO NOT ATTACK YOUR COMPUTER, BURN THINGS, VANDALIZE A BOY'S LOCKER-ROOM, ROB A VINTAGE STORE, SMASH YOUR BROTHER WITH GUITARS, OR OTHER DISRUPTIVE BEHAVIORAL ACTIVITIES
But wait
if you're Amish, then you wouldn't have electricity, which means you wouldn't have an outlet to plug stuff in, which means you wouldn't have the Internet nor a computer, which means you'd never read this! So HA!   *silence*   Ahem
Anyway, the song has some meaning in the fact that HARD ROCK KICKS AZZ
Wanna fight?   And for some reason, I have 'When I Come Around' (by Green Day) stuck in my head
Okay wutevah
The video gives out a little creepiness with a backround melody
I'll see if I can't practice on my handy-dandy keyboard
The scenery is awesome
So the moral of the story is,   WATCH IT
Games    Star Fox is just one of the games in the E³ 2004 (Electronic Entertainment Expo 2004)
Nintendo Power has taken an inside look at some hot new games coming out for hte GCN and GBA
They also unleashed a little powersystem called the 'Nintendo DS'
And---well---look 'er up for yourself
Some titles for the GCN worth looking out for include: Metroid Prime 2: Echoes; Resident Evil 4; Star Fox; Geist; StarCraft: Ghost; Advance Wars: Under Fire; Prince of Persia; Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow; Goldeneye: Rogue Agent (yes that's right, it's a Bond game only this time you are NOT MI6
I think
), and others
I was most excited at the news of another Star Fox game, bringing Fox McCloud back into the pilot's cockpit of his beloved Arwing
Joining him once again is my favorite gung-ho, kick-ass, take-no-crap-from-nobody avian, Falco Lombardi
Unfortunately I have reason to believe that a valued crew member will die (and my predictions tend to be right
*sigh*)
But they say both the storyline and multiplayer gaming are awesome
And some good space battles and inter-planetary fights are what I'm looking forward to
Only question: Is the villian once again the deposed evil emperor Andross? And are the members of the Star Wolf team still alive? Only time wil tell
The game is scheduled to release this November
StarCraft is finally staying away from the PC and launching StarCraft: Ghost, where you are a Confederate---what else---ghost specialist
But I can't wait for some good, alien butt-kickin' fun, and it looks promising
Lastly is the short movie clip of an upcoming Legend of Zelda game due to release sometime in 2005
It features an adult Link---and let's face it, folks: Link looks hot
The graphics are beautiful
All three games are a must for me
Cheers!   ~Valkyrie Juno signing off~
F f L l U u   At least I think so
I totally hate you today
First last night, what with seeing the ex-girlfriend for an hour then today, you're supposed to take care of me and what do you do? NOTHING
Sometimes I ask myself why I put up with this
She's not as 'gross' as I remembered her to be--which made things a lot worse
Seeing her, standing near me, my boyfriend, my friends
What a horrible excuse for a weekend

Think you're being a non-conformist?  Think you're somehow unique and different from everyone else?  Good luck with all that
It's an illusion
There is no unique, there is no different - maybe just different combinations of choices in life that form the 'unique' you
If you strive to be different, trust me, you're still conforming in some ways
Conforming to cultural and social standards
You can't help but be a consumer in this culture
Some companies specifically market to the counter-culture, such that the counter-culture is a culture in itself
For example, tattoos, body piercing, body modification of any kind is an attempt to be different
But really people see other people who have modified their bodies, and they want to be like these other people
Simply waving hello to someone, or nodding your head, or whatever - these are culturally accepted standards of behavior
Imagine instead when someone says hello to you, that you respond with something random and unexpected
People might think you're a little crazy
But if you continue to respond to hello in this way, you are now conforming to a new code of behavior
What does it mean to live life fully?  To enjoy life?  To enjoy living?    Whenever I go to a restaurant and order food, I am at odds with myself over different things, like the cost of the meal, what I want to eat (I never really know), what's good for me, I'm at such odds with myself that I change my mind frequently, never really happy with what I've chosen, always thinking I should have gotten something else
Will I like what I'm getting?  Maybe it's good to eat something that I don't like, just for the experience of it
Like eating octopus tentacles, for their chewy texture and odd feeling in the mouth
Should I just get whatever I'm familiar with?  What if this place doesn't prepare it the way I like it though?  I find that a lot with salmon - restaurants frequently overcook it, leaving it a little too tough
Fish can be so delicate to cook
Maybe I should eat vegetarian, because what right do I have over the animals to eat them
How barbaric!  Maybe I shouldn't use any animal products or any products that have been tested on animals, because it's inhumane
But do I really want to spend my life trying to keep in mind what's been tested on animals - only consuming from certain companies that are conscious of animal rights?  Is that what my life is about?    How should I spend the time that I have on this earth?  I waste so much time
So much
Watching TV - movies at night, porn, masturbating
It's very enjoyable at the time, but I don't really gain any value from it
I play computer games - that a big time sink
I sit at work surfing the web, blogging, reading and writing email, checking my stock quotes, reading stock message boards
Oh yeah, and I work once in a while, too
I haven't really worked - and I mean worked - a 40 hour week in I don't know how long
So what the fuck am I doing at work?  I'm getting paid for sitting on my ass basically wasting my time and doing a couple of work-related tasks -- just enough to get by
Then again, maybe my manager is out of touch with what's really going on
It would be cool to be doing something self-expressive, something artistic with my life
But then I might be stuck in a different rut - stuck in the rut of having no money and not being able to afford decent housing for me and my kids
Not being able to afford nice vacations
Not being able to afford netflix and cable tv and a broadband connection to the net
I need broadband so I can remote into work occasionally and do real work
Mostly I need broadband for porn
It's sad, isn't it
I guess I'm addicted
So many addictions, so little time
Go see the movie
Go to the real website  urlLink here
It's a good album, surprise
Generally speaking, one can periodize the history of Stereolab into four distinct eras:  the first, comprising the albums  Peng  and  Transient Random-Noise Bursts With Announcements  could be glibly described as their punk period
These two albums feature the most simplistic chordal structures, the instrumentation is more traditionally 'rock', and the grooves are straightforward and driving
Next is a period of increasing sophistication, with more emphasis on the organ and more interest in Latin American forms ( The Groop Played 'Space-Age Bachelor Pad Music' ,  Mars Audiac Quintet ); this progress culminates in  Emperor Tomato Ketchup  and  Dots And Loops , which showcase the canonical Stereolab sound:  French 60s pop classicism is the most apparent element of the sound, and the Neu! cribs are mated with electronic flourishes of a more recent vintage
Following this is what I call 'the crap years'
The next three albums,  Cobra And Phases Group Play Voltage In The Milky Night ,  The First Of The Microbe Hunters , and  Sound-Dust ,  are bad and I don't enjoy listening to them
So I don't, and therefore    I can't describe them for you
Fortunately, however,  Margerine Eclipse  is not bad
It is quite good, in fact
In part, it represents a return to the sound of the  Dots And Loops  era, although the extent to which this is true is unclear to me, because as I said I don't listen to the albums which came out between this one and that
That's not to say it's a stylistic retreat, although Stereolab appear to have resurrected elements of their earlier sounds in making this one
'Margerine Rock' for example combines the sort of dorky organ line one finds on  Emperor Tomato Ketchup  with a very  urlLink  Peng! -y  sense of flow
Plus some gonzo guitar histrionics
So it's all good
What seems to distinguish this album from the previous few is the attitude
The songs here are punchier, the playing more aggressive, the mood a little more sour
That's not to say that this is an all-new, all-ass-kickin' Stereolab, but it goes quite a long way in convincing me that the familiar on this album is not simply in due to retrenchment or a wilful shining up of the old as the new
I agree - today's Friday 5 is kind of a joke

What a stupid thing really
not stupid
'how totally peurile and inanely naive'
thats sounds better
Perceptions: Thats hitting the nail on its head
Don't blame  me , blame my  perceptions , don't blame my perceptions, blame the processes that gave rise to them, ahhh the processes
Don't blame the processes either, because processes are but a slave to ambient circumstance and the trigger of stimulus
Stimulus is determined by a billion other factors (not including destiny
you didn't think i was heading in that direction did you ?) and what can we say about circumstance eh ? I'm rambling

Well, I'm gonna see what Josh is doing and then the dishes
Today, during an boring lecture from my teacher in history; i wrote down every thing that ever stoud out to me that a guy has said to me
Wheather funny, good, saddning, happi, or hurtfull all of it
I realized i have had many of the same sentances said by many diferetn young men, in many diferent ways
But yet all the same
What my conclution came to be is, we are all looking for secnificans, and love
All my friends, ex-boy friends, were looking for exzactly what i was looking for
But how can two loe each other when they dn't even know they'r own self- or why they are on this earth
What is our reasoning for being here? To wake up every day, smoke a joint go to school, kiss afew brake a few, go ot work - smoke some cigs, drink some at a party where your not having fun- wake up to a stranger and wonder how the hell did this happen? This is not our reasoning- this is not why we are here to wake up every day- but yet be asleep our whole life
Never waking up till we are face to face with Hell itself and its beholders- than do we relise what we were suppost to be?  About two months ago- i had an waking up nightmerro
the only thing was it wasn't just a dream
I had finnaly done it- i took those little pills- they seemed to challanges me to swoolow them
i was so scared to do it- but what the hell- life sucked- i screwed up- Brad doesn't want me- Sam is to good for me- i just F'd up w/ Justin, and my parents deserve a better kid- someone they can trust
'God- you screwed up- and i am gonna fix it by giving my self to you and not waking up
!'  Well that is what i htought- but isn't really what happened
I don't remeber very much, just stbing I
Vs peircing my viens- digging in my thin skin trying to fing my shriviled blood
My heart was slowing- the nurses running- yet i can remeber one saying to another-'Why save someone when she doesn't even want to live? What a selfish bitch
' All i could think of was calling Brad- He told me to promiss i'd never do it- agin - i promissed him- but what would he care?  So i closed my eyes and asked God to take me home, my stomech felt like a not inside my through burned like nothingid ever felt
I felt the clumps in my throught but nothing would come up- they had me on my back- i couldn't sit up it was choking me - i couldn't talk
My arm wouldn't move- my lips were numb- i couldn't think anymore- my face was hurtingfrom a reasont slap from my moms hand
Than it came to me- falling into darkness- like that tunnol thing- light was comeing i was reaching out my hand but right then it was like a rubberband- it poped and i was flying backwards into nothiness
Loneleness- only hurt and pain
All i saw was what i did wrong- who id hurt- whod i lied to
I was alone forever
Then it flashe dover again and again like a movie i was in a cascet and was looking out up- saw every one i knew and poeple i didn't yet know my kids- or you know it wasn't really thier faces just thier presents
And they were dropping white Oleanders and Magnolia and white Cali lillies on me - i was creeming to them- 'i am not dead- please help me i am not dead! i am not dead!' But they didn't here me they left and started throwing dirt on me- they went on w/thier lives and forgot about me
Like i had never exzistead
And i woke up in a childrens hostpital room
I guess that was the only room avalible for the night
I really didn't care either way
I was sore- my parents asleep on a small cot next to me- i didn't want to ghome and face my consiquices but i knew it was bettre than hell
I don't know my pourpous or why the hell i am herer
I don't know why so many young men were torn from my life- but it is making me stronger and a better person
Out of every guy i have 'been with' (lack of better words) My favorite  has been Samuel, and Brad
First Brad- if you ever read this - wich i'm sure you aren't from what Daniel tells you i know you here nothingof how i really feel about you
You were an awsome friend- i am so glad i met you
You tought me a way of life that was so amazing and fufilling to my soul
Ilove you Brad Stock and am very proud of you for following your dreams
God bless
I pray some day i will get to be in eternaty with you in Hevean
Becous i don't want you to go where i visited
You deserve better Brad-
And Samuel, God wher to star? Well if it wern't for you i wouldn't have fought so hard to live
You have said some really hard things to take but- have always made me think-
I have never been a person to cry much- untill you broke me
I became human again
I htink i have cried with oand about you more than anyhting in my life
I believ you broke a dam in my emotions that spilled out all to gather- sorry)
;) But God- i love you to much- and i ma very proud and honnored to know you
You have the sweetess smile i've ever seen
it can melt my angeryess emotion
You are truly a wonderful friend to have
I have no mor ewords to explain how you have been a help and how i feel about you
Samuel Henderson, God bless i know i have a friend for life
And Ryan! You were the only person that knew about and know about my whole life- and you've stuck around
the thing i love about you is you are my brother and even if you liked me you would never take advantage of me
You are so sweet and always have the right words
You make me laugh when i feel like crying- you listen even when i raddle off- on some stupid shirt i saw at the stor
You allow me to be me- and not some one els
You like me for being bekah and not just another person
I am very proud of you- Ryan Berren, you are a truly awsome man of God
You have a gorgous heart
Ilove you lots my buddy
And Jones - i am finnaly over you- i miss your laugh, i wish you were better
But you have so much hurt
Just let it go-
I love you Jones Lee- and i will forever pray for you
and as long as i live in Boise i will go Vist your mothers grave
She is proud of you- but you must go on liveing - please get off the drugs- i really don't want to visit you in prison for sailling it anymore
Please don't do that
I hope that the Marines Seils are wher you'll finnaly find your slf
God i love you too
Kim- you are awsome! You just say it like it is- i love you to death
Kim Forrey
There are many more to talk about but i am so sore and out of thoghts right now- But- For all my freinds, boy-girls i love ya'll! God bless, thank you for being  part of my life

a new template
Yes I could not resist the urge to have a change, well the old template served us well all this time
The night was just coming to life highlighting a moon crescent that was perfectly incomplete
There she was alone, standing on the edge of the shore, holding on to a half empty bottle of beer like it was a prop
She could hear the waves crashing in and out on the water while a myriad of diamonds bounce off foamy waves, sparkling in the moon glow for a split second only to get swept away by waves crashing at the shore
Obviously, she was trying to ignore the maddening monotony of those sad songs that were being played on a nearby hut
For a moment she was contented with the solitude but then out of the darkness, save for the lone moonlight; was him, watching her from a near distance
She noticed right away that he was walking towards her
She quickly returned her icy gaze back to the swaying waves
“I—I’m---sorry—“ he managed to mumble
She turned her head and met his gaze
“Try not to think about it
” Her voice trailed off into gasps
And for him, it seemed to be something so easy to say
He meant well, she knew, but words meant little to a worried mind
He attempted nothing more however, and she was thankful for that at least
Kind words were enough on his part
He could do no more harm than that she thought
“I know—that I’ve done you wrong,” he said  “Don’t try to think about it,” she said again
There was a subtle resignation on her eyes, as if to say that it was ok to be unwanted, that it was ok to have nothing
Her words lilting like music in his ears, a single sentence but the pitch, the lilts and the cadences, the nuances of pronunciation made him then realized how it felt good to hear her speak
But softness lacked the weight of any true resolve
“I heard that you’re leaving
I just can’t –'  “Can’t what? I’ve been patient with you for too long
It’s time I let go,” she said
“And what do you suggest I do then?” He finally asked
He did not expect an answer from her, nor did she fall short of his expectations
Though it would’ve been nice if she had, he thought
If only her kind words could whisk away his problems and maybe a few of her own
“You’ll be fine without me
” She said softly
“All along the little lies invade the spaces between our relationship
We seem to get buried with every crashing doubt
I sink every time you make a fool out of me
And I guess now’s just the right time to end this
” She added
She looked intently at the direction of the  Polaris  still holding the now half-full bottle of beer
He noticed that she seemed well that night, her eyes twinkling with the sparkle they had had long before they were lovers
For a brief fraction of a moment, she felt a renewed sense of focus on her being
She felt like an early seafarer, searching for stars for answers
“I must go home
” Her voice playing in the wind, telling him that all was right as it should be in the world
So she walked past him leaving him alone on the edge of the shore
As for him, the thought still lingered like a sickness, seeping into the cracks of his mind
She felt it too, he knew, but  not thinking about it  was best left as merely kind words, and nothing more
The most amazing thing happened to me a while ago
&nbsp; I was sitting in some silly gay bar, drinking some silly drink concocted by some silly gay bar tender, when a nice boy came over to talk to me
He was cute and sweet, and he had really pretty eyes
&nbsp; He asked me to join him and his friends on the other side of the bar
&nbsp; I had nothing better to do, so I picked up my bag and followed
&nbsp; I figured I would have another drink, and then go home
&nbsp;  There were two women sitting at the bar, facing the other direction
&nbsp;&nbsp;The sweet boy&nbsp;began to introduce his friends
&nbsp; 'This is my friend Kate, from out of town
'&nbsp; She turned her head and smiled
&nbsp; She offered her hand and I took it
&nbsp; She said something
&nbsp; I didn't hear anything
&nbsp; I was dumbfounded
&nbsp; This doesn't happen to me
&nbsp; Normally, I am as cool as a frozen cucumber
&nbsp; Normally I can strike up a witty conversation and keep up with just about anyone
&nbsp; A moment passed, and she appeared to be patiently waiting for me to respond to whatever it was she had said
&nbsp; All I could do was stare at her blankly
&nbsp; I blushed, smiled and said 'I like your shirt
'&nbsp; She smiled again and asked me to sit next to her
&nbsp; I thought I was going to throw up
&nbsp; I felt like such a silly little girl
&nbsp; People don't have this effect on me
&nbsp; Ever
&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I felt blissfully awkward and elatedly nauseated for the rest of the evening as we sat as close to each other as we could without giving too much away
&nbsp; I forgot about everyone else there
&nbsp; The sweet boy had collected quite the congregation of lesbians, and was corralling them to the dance floor
&nbsp; Kate and I sat close to each other on bar stools and watched
&nbsp; For the rest of the evening, I fought the urge to drag her into the cloak room with me
now I wish I hadn't fought that urge at all
&nbsp;  I knew intuitively that there was something special and wonderful about this girl
&nbsp; She is constantly on my mind
&nbsp; She makes me do crazy things like talk on the phone for hours at a time
&nbsp; Anyone who knows me is very familiar with my aversion to telephone conversation
&nbsp; My friends and family complain about it constantly
&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So far, I have discovered a brilliant witty mind, a sweet gentle heart, and a cautious and honest desire

Colour me livid, here
Got the car sorted out recently, as I've mentioned in an earlier entry, this means that it's getting transferred into my name for legal reasons
(although my mum'll still own it to all intents and purposes)  The main reason for this was that it's only when I'm the car's registered in my name that I'm able to get insurance in my name
And since I was expected to contribute to the cost, I was only gonna do that if I could start building up a no-claims bonus
So I started shopping around for quotes, and most places were quoting me about £700 for a year's fully comprehensive cover
I finally went for elephant, 'cos they would give me it for £462, which seemed reasonable (ish)
Got an email today to say that because I added their breakdown cover, it's an extra £70 or so for the year
Which I think is a bit excessive
Actually, I think it's a lot excessive
Further rage came about when talking to Lynn last night in the cathouse, and finding out that she's paying pretty much the same as me
Now, no disrespect to her, but she's 19 and has already been in an accident that's written off a car (yes, I know it wasn't her fault), whereas I'm 24, and have 7 years of claim-free driving
I can't help but feel that I'm being punished for being male
Insurance is like that though
More accidents and claims involve males
Therefore, all males are more dangerous
Fuck right off
Sometimes I'd almost like a personal hearing in cases like this, if only so they could see that I'm not a boy racer in a bammed up nedmobile
Coast Guard Stays Neutral   In this prior  post  , we linked to a report that the Coast Guard had determined that Cape Wind posed a 'manageable risk' for navigation and thus, supported the project
Turns out, we - and more accurately, the article to which we linked - spoke too soon:  as reported in   Another Flap Over Cape Wind: Coast Guard Remains Neutral  , Alexis Tonti, Martha's Vineyard Gazette (9/19/03), Coast Guard officials reiterate that they have taken no official position on the project, and are only beginning to review its potential impacts
In act, contrary to articles that the Coast Guard submitted reports to the Corps, the only study submitted was one prepared by Cape Wind's consultatnt and reviewed by the Coast Guard - which offered concerns and suggestions for future study
Hey! Today i actually got off my fat arse and did something
I went to the city with some friends and I have gotta say that I suck at that DDR dancing thingo in Galaxy World

This is the weirdest thing I've stumbled across in a while
urlLink Afterlife Telegrams
Unbelievable
currently listening to:  doves -  the man who told everything    '
and i feel, like i'm losing my head, i didn't mean to stay
'   i've got nothing to say, apart from why the hell can't anyone find an effective cure for the common cold? (it's 'common' after all
) and  why, oh why , must my mum always say ' a cold will last seven days if you treat it, and a week if you leave it alone'
? it wasn't amusing the first time she said it, and it's certainly not amusing after three million times of hearing it
but really, i'm not in as bad a mood as i may sound here
just wishing i didn't have a cold, or could stay off work (with full pay) while i've got it
*sigh* *sneeze* *sigh* an early night is in order, i think

stupid van

then the picture is like a thumbnail of the picture and he blows it up to a full page and wasts teh ink then hits the computer
blaaaaaaaaaaaaah!! ass
I am back
I tried to bite a couple of people, but didn't bite them  at the end
Mostly growled
Anyway, done a partial Xristamss shopping at the  urlLink Art Fest  (yes, we people lost in the middle of nowhere of PA, have to do our shopping all year round
Imagine, how difficult it is every year to bring back home to Italy and France something American, but still nice and classy so people over there can use them!)
At least that was something positive done
Would need a few pages of writing on all my bad behavior of this weekend, but I have absolutely to finish writing the article by tomorrow
I have seriously to do lots of work, beginning NOW
Evil  PARTY LIKE IT'S 1999 (B
)    urlLink       urlLink       urlLink       I've heard it suggested that once you go black, you never go back
Personally speaking, I'll take electricity any day
The city went black for all of 16 hours, which in the grand scheme of things doesn't seem like such a big deal but let me tell you, I went batty by minute five
Luckily, it turns out that my downstairs neighbors are incredibly proactive people
They dropped by to ask me if I had any perishables in the fridge
I said no, but I did offer them some sausage and salty nuts
They declined, but invited me down to the front of the apartment for the Blackout BBQ
The girls went to buy charcoal while all the dudes in the building made a fast break for the nearest Indian convenience store with a liquor case
It's obvious everyone had the same thing on their minds: Someone is going to get 'blackout lucky
'  People brought down their perishables and folding chairs and sat and drank beer while a girl whose pants kept threatening to fall down tended to the fire
The grill was set up on the garbage can cubby and the folding chairs mingled among the day's uncollected garbage
The rats, whose turf we had overtaken for the night, retreated for fear of getting BBQ'd
This was a classy operation
We had to drink fast because nothing was going to keep the beer cool for long
The girls waved to passers-by and shouted, Happy Blackout! At some point, I think propositioned the blonde, but I think I did so in a very sloppy way
It was classy
Very classy
anyone up for a game of iconquer tonight? we should give it a test run, huh? download it if you don't have it from the apple site
For Lesson 4: We had to shoot a whole reel of film using only one inanimate object as our subject
We had to try and transofrm our subject so that we were looking at in a way that was different to how we'd normally see it
The photographs were required to be taken outside, in one session and in black and white
I chose to photograph the antenna on the roof
These pictures were taken at around midday
Never ask what, ask why
Bush, why is he in Office?  Why did Bush receive presidency? The total of votes from American Citizens were in favor of Al Gore
Yet, in a miraculous turn of events, Bush was pulled into presidency
Bush’s father was the president also
Now, what can you say the odds are, of a man, becoming president, even though his father was also a president
What are the odds, that the person with the same name, of all the families, that family was lucky enough
Of all the times, this time and era was the one
With the Twin Towers, and the war with Iraq, and Iraq’s possibility of getting nuclear weapons
(Not newk-you-lar)  Now, lets calculate these odds right now
President George Bush, father is now an ex president, fighting in the same war, got presidency even though popular vote swayed the other direction, and all the other mitigating factors
George, W
Was placed into office
Why, is the question
In order to find out why he was put into office, all that does it take a quick glance at what he has done in office so far
One, revealed the French and their affiliation with Iraq, (Bad thing to do
) Screwed up our UN agreements, allowed the good `Ol patriot act that has helped convict…
Nobody knows
If any at all
He has created a war with not only the Taliban, but the Iraqi regime, he has captured Saddam
And he has used some of our reserve Oil, he has stopped focusing on the homeland so much, made it harder for children to graduate, gotten several of our soldiers killed and used up our marines, Army, Army reserve, and Navy
Bush, has used up endless amounts of resources, and created a soar in gas prices
What bush is doing may be good, but it may also be bad
Lets take all of this and lay it out in pieces
French Affiliation with Iraq
He put that out into the open
Bad mistake, now France knows we don’t trust them, now they’re going to be extra careful and not screw up
Just wait and see, France will try to do something here in the near future, something discreet, but it will get let out into the open
(I’ll go over what that might be later
Bush screwed up our UN agreements and led the United States to believe in going to war with Iraq
What does that make the United states look like? Remember people, nobody cares about the government, if the president makes a decision, the rest of the world calls it “America’s” decision
Now we’re all the police of the world
The patriot act, what has it done? Nothing, nothing at all it seems like
Wait no, it allowed the government to search our computers, our files, and our personal lives
I have nothing to hide, but I don’t believe that the government should have access like that
The war on Iraq/Taliban/Possibly Iran… Either Bush hasn’t heard of Divide and conquer, or he’s just an idiot
And I’ll go over what I think will happen with all of these when I’m done listing it
He captured Saddam
You know that thing you do when you’re overwhelmed? When you brush your hair back with your hands? I’m doing that right now
He used some of our reserve oil
It’s called reserve for a reason
RESERVE
He’s not paying too much attention to the homeland
You know the homeland? Where things actually matter?  8
He made it harder for kids to graduate
No child left behind
Well, what’s he going to do about all the 2
0 children that are going to be left behind?  9
What exactly, are our forces doing in Iraq? They’re not doing anything
They’re getting killed
Sure they’re killing back but, we aren’t supposed to lose a single man
Bush, is doing some huge things here, some pretty huge things that are not getting attention
I’ll start with French’s Affiliation with Iraq
France, Russia, and Germany, three countries that didn’t want to go to war with Iraq… we found out why, they were in direct trading relations with Iraq… Iraq, was not trying to keep harmless trading relations
Saddam was going to retaliate, get his economy rolling, the Russians were found making trades of Night vision goggles to Iraq
Why is that? Why would you need Night vision? Why would you need to secretly break the trading laws and why was the country under such investigation? It’s because he had something to hide, and it wasn’t bombs
If He had bombs, he’d say something, he’d make threats and accusations that the US/UN/anybody he wants to ruin, is doing something to harm the world
He was preparing for something  The U
thought they had weapons of mass destruction (WMD‘s) we were either wrong, or we were right and they are hidden
If he didn’t have them, that means that he was smart, and he wasn’t going to blow his cover with Germany France and Russia just yet, he’d be able to get some money pulled in
But, if he does have them, and they are just hidden, could you take a guess as to why they’re not being used? Because he was waiting for something
If he wasn’t waiting for something, then he’d be using them
What is that something though? Lets take a look at what Saddam had, and what he was getting
He was trying to boost his economy, (So money

Played hockey on the Olympic-sized rink at Bloomingotn Ice Gardens last night until about 12:40AM this morning
That's a big ice sheet -- the same one the 1980 Olympic Team practiced on
It was cool, especially with the storm outside lighting up the sky
I'm going to play every Wednesday night with these guys
Two times a week is perfect

James Smith: Is that a bomb sniffing dog? Dog Trainer: Yeah

James Smith: Hey what kind of dog is that? Dog Trainer: A golden lab
GREAT job at Swing Show Nichole! We all thought you were great
Next year maybe play guitar, sing and do the bunny hop or chicken walk at the same time
COOL! I'm really proud of you
john, i'm sorry you're so upset about the loss of the holy ghost
perhaps you can contact god via prayer and he will rehire him
just hang in there, man
At the moment i have the strangest craving for watching a Zack Files show
it puzzles me too
And Aris is the coolest!
I'll start with the initial reason I was gone
I was grounded
Why? Let me explain
The twelfth of this month was the Sheared Wit 2000 - 3000 / End of the School Year party
And being the fun-loving person I am, I was the one who threw it
Big mistake
I'm not throwing another party until graduation
Anyway, I found out that day that I have three less friends than I thought I did
So here's what happened:  My brother is a moron
But we all knew that already
Anyway, Pa was out shopping for snacks and such (that he was supposed to have had done already) and Zack comes downstairs looking for him, which he  knew  he wasn't supposed to do
Being the annoying spastic child he is, we (my 'friends' and I) are quickly annoyed by him, and thusly Brett gets the bright idea to ducktape his hands behind his back and his mouth shut
So he's kicking and jumping and struggling while Lane, Drew, and I are trying to hold him down
Naturally, we decide to tape his feet too
Drew isn't exactly gentle with Zack, and his head gets banged on the floor
And so he cries
And cries
And cries some more
And it wasn't because it hurt (he told me so himself after all was said and done)
And he's still crying when Pa gets home so I get grounded (but not before I get into a huge argument with him)
So now my brother hates me more (if that's possible), I get into an argument with Pa (oh fun), and I'm embarrassed out of my eyeballs in front of my friends as I'm grounded into what seems like an eternity
But that's not why I'm mad
Na, the worst part was that I didn't get   ONE FUCKING APOLOGY
From any of them
Some friends they turned out to be
So now I'm down to five friends (more like four friends and one boyfriend, we have yet to see how this turns out
It goes from nine to five in one event
Sortof
Noodle never showed up, nor did she give me any notice whatsoever that she wasn't going to show up
I have an idea of why, but I still need to talk with her about it
But it's not like me and her are really close friends anyway
I'm trusting fewer and fewer people nowadays
I'm keeping more and more secrets
Not other people's secrets (well, I do, but that's not what I'm talking about)
I'm going back to how I used to be
A sour, mean, and friendless hermet
But at least that way I wouldn't havve to expect anyone to  attempt  to befriend me
What excellent friends I have
To my still-existing friends (currently Monica Ginny Genell Ryan and Dave), I lurve you all and none of the above insults and/or complaints are meant to be directed at you
You all still rock

cept i feel sorry for all the 'bigger people' out there, who never get rewarded with simplicity and ease
i feel like doggie number #3
oh, and his dad kept coming in the room

(from band, the great melder of cliques)
so that just makes rob that id ont know
lol but he seems nice, he was wearing lovely swim trunks to match his hawaiian theme for the day
robby seemed a little starved for attention

lol he's alright
well my dad just barged in the room and told me to go to sleep so this is to be continued
ps josh reads this too
Oh hey! Saturday

My best forte so to speak

urlLink Afterschool Programs
ERIC Digest
This ERIC Digest is by Linda Lumsden
From the ERIC Digest:  According to Jodi Wilgoren of the New York Times (2000), recent growth in afterschool programming 'represents nothing less than the reimagining of the school day for the first time in generations
'    Afterschool programs are increasingly viewed as one viable way of bridging the gap between the end of the school day and the time parents get home from work
They have the potential to provide a safe, supervised place for children and youth to participate in constructive activities and form positive relationships with peers and adults
Such programs may also supplement what children and youth learn during the regular school day and expose students to a wide array of enrichment opportunities that promote cognitive, social, emotional, physical, and moral growth and development
The caliber of afterschool programs varies widely, however, and so it is important for administrators and policy- makers to be familiar with factors that tend to set apart high-quality programs
Otherwise, millions of children may end up being 'warehoused in inadequate programs' (Grossman 2002)
This Digest briefly discusses why afterschool programs are needed, what potential benefits may be, what challenges may affect the viability of programs, what factors are identified with high-quality programs, and what policy issues need to be addressed
I went to the racebannon show tonight, and Chuck D just for your info, they brought the noise
Somehow my friend hector slept during the last half of their set
i dont know, but before he fell asleep he asked me 'whats up with everyone having the captain caveman hair' hahahaha
For those of you with the above mentioned captain caveman hair it was him who said it not me
Good show, caught the act before racebannon but didnt catch their name, local two piece group with just a drummer and guitarist screaming his lungs out
good stuff
Saw part of right turn danger, it was past time to put hector to bed, but what i heard sounded good
Now i'm thinking of guitars, amps, a frequency generator and how i can combine all three
I love reading this
hehe 'Escort Services?'  Yes, the boy likes you
Awesome
Go get him
The Charlie Rose Drinking Game    The art of the interview is to draw out the subject while the interviewer recedes into the background
Although  Charlie Rose  delivers the goods on any given weekday, he uses the first person singular personal pronoun often
Excedingly often
Okay: all the damned time
Charlie, thank you for giving us those great interviews with  Kiefer Sutherland  and  David Westin  and  John Kerry , but honestly: It's not all about you
All those I's and me's Charlie, puh-lease
So, in the spirit of Charlie Rose's energetic use of the first person singular personal pronoun,  The Corsair  proposes The Charlie Rose Drinking Game
It's late at night, it was a hard day at work, you are about to go to bed and Charlie is interviewing some Master of the Universe -- so why not have a drinkie poo on the Chuckster? Every time Charlie uses the first person singular personal pronoun, down a shot
And don't use any of the cheap stuff, ladies and gentlemen, this is Charlie Rose and that whole 'corridors of power Illuminati Trilateral Commission' thingie we're talking about
You better recognize
If you are still conscious after the drinking game, then you are a candidate for the  urlLink Jared Paul Stern  Ironman competition
urlLink Slacktivist   urlLink is   urlLink the   urlLink best   urlLink blog   urlLink ever
urlLink I mean it

Ive now moved to Gateshead and am currently working as a Studio Administrator for a company called  urlLink Dataform  in Newcastle
I bought my own car and am in the process of doing it up, you can view my progress here at  urlLink Rover Project 2004   Everything seems to be going very well for me, im very happy at the moment and hope to stay that way
Moving up here has been the best decision I have ever made
:-)  Post more later
Yahaaaa footy starts today alrighty then:) england are going to win you know it
Today was just very boring
Nothing at all happened
I was planning on going out but of course my mother takes hours to take a shower and get dressed then leave the house
Takes about 3 hours before we go outside from the time she says 'lets go out'
But anyway, i didnt go with them cause i was arguing with her
Shes crazy
She really needs to see a psychiatrist
Anyway, they came back when they were supposed to go food shopping and they didnt
She walks in with a Steve Madden bag
Now why is that not surprising
She comes up to me and im arguing with her and shit, she tells me to stop and then gets all aggravated like and putting me down by saying im a sicko and a lunatic
After that she tells me she got me a phone
Of course that was a lie
She got herself a phone and gave me her old one
Then after another 30 minutes, she tells me we need to go get food and stuff
We leave the house, she wanted to go to a restaurant to eat but i told her that im not, because theres no way in hell that im going into a high class restaurant with my mother and brother
They will start a scene, and i cannot handle that embarassment
Thats the last thing i want
So she takes us to the supermarket
I stay in the car because shes just so fucking embarassing
She supposedly is a little hard of hearing and constantly yells saying 'What?' like extremely loud and she did it 3 times in the parking lot, and i cant walk while shes starting that shit
So i stood in the car
And thats all
I don't know why that's my title, but I had that song stuck in my head all day today, along with Carol King (you're so far away
doesn't anybody stay in one place anymore)
I have to say it was very nostalgic to hear that song, it's like my freaking childhood
I know every word to every song on the Tapestry cassette
Anyways, Katy, Katie and I went down and rode bikes at Mission Bay, except for we only had two bikes so Katy rode the scooter
It was really fun, but the water park would have been better
We're watching one of my all time favorite movies tonight
Now and Then!!! Yay yay I love that movie
Back in the day Rachael Roubitchek and I would watch it together and talk about how that was going to be us in 20 years
Too bad I don't talk to her anymore
Oh well
Oy! So I guess I have another purpose with this Blog
Since nobody reads it anyway, I'm just going to use it to keep track of my DIET! Oops
I mean, my LIFESTYLE CHANGE! (This being my second one in as many years, har har) A little background on that:   2002  I was never a tiny person, but I really porked up in college
I'm only 5'1' and I weighed in at about 175 lbs
Yikes! Too many pizzas and pints of cookies-n-cream at 4 AM! I was in denial, because you know how friends and family are
'Gads, no, you're not THAT big!' Yeah, I was
One day in April I decided I was done with being fat
So I counted calories, ate right most of the time, and exercised at least every other day
And I lost 50 lbs
Go, me! Felt great! But then
January 2003  My brother dies unexpectedly
Suddenly, the term LIFESTYLE CHANGE had more to do with that than my eating and exercise habits
Over the past year, I've regained about 15 of those 50 lbs that I worked so hard to lose
The shame!   Today  I actually hauled ass out of bed at 8 AM, exercised, and ate a reasonably healthy breakfast
(One medium scrambled egg, one slice of toast, 1 cup of orange juice, and a glass of WATER!) So I'm off to a good start
I'm hoping that by keeping track of my habits here I'll be motivated to keep it up
I wanna look hot in my Jager tank and lucky jeans at Thunder in the Valley
So there
everything is so screwed up
didn't do well in the physics test today
didn't do well in chemistry test yesterday
didn't do well in maths test today

silver cars are apparently  urlLink safer  to drive than any other color
In case you don't know who alex of pittsburgh (acewepeel) is, he's been a friend of mine for 2 years
But here's the catch
I haven't actually met him
He was just some random dude I started talking to online cause his sn had to do with weezer, and he was on an snl board, my 2 favorite things
We discovered we were the same age, and had a lot of similar interests and opinions
Tv shows, music, movies
We like all the same things
We would both say what the other was just thinking or saying at the same exact time
I think the creepiest was when we were both listening to some obscure random song at the same time, when we were asking what we were each listening to
We talk everyday at length, and have been doing so for EXACTLY 2 YEARS NOW!  And I'm not just talking about 'hey, whats up notthing yeah', we talk about everything
I know so much about this kid, and I haven't even seen him face to face
He's like a best friend or a twin brother
I've had other online 'friends', but none like him
With the others, there are fallouts, or just not as close
Then there's his friend, Kiersten (kiersten1232) whom he goes to school with
My IM's have been quoted in alex's profile many times, and one time Kiersten noticed me there and IMed me to see who I was
I still remember when we first talked, I said I was Jesus
We hit it off immediately
We would talk for HOURS on end, and our conversations would be so addictice, it would literally take us 25 minutes after we would first say 'bye' to actually sign off
Kiersten is an amazing girl
We don't even have that much in common, but we get along so well and tell each other everything
She calls me her diary haha and will tell me stuff she wont even tell her real friends
I know it sounds really pathetic and crap, but if I knew her in person I would ask her out in a second
Well on the weekend of August 7th
DUN DUN DUN
WE ARE ACTUALLY GONNA MEET
My mom's bf has family in Upper Saint Clair, where alex and kiersten live
WHAT A FREAKIN COINCIDENCE
So him, me, and mom are taking a trip there, and I guess while he visits family, I'll be with alex and kiersten
I'm still in denial that its actually gonna happen
It's going to be sooooo weird
I'm gonna 'meet' these people that I already know inside and out
I met an internet friend before, well thats cause she lived around the block from my dads house, but we met online, and when I first met her, I was in denial
It was the weirdest sensation
So I can't even imagine what its gonna be like for alex and kiersten
My body may spontaneously combust
I may die right there
And I can be shy around new people
am I gonna be shy with these guys?  I don't know
Originally alex and I planned it that Kiersten wouldn't know I was coming, that scheduling conflicts were preventing me from coming
We wanted it so she would have NO idea
I would just walk up to her house, ring the doorbell
She would answer it, and I would be there, with alex videotaping hahaha
However, we had to make sure she was still available, and even more than 2 weeks in advance, she actually had drivers ed for that day
Alex and I panicked at first, but then settled on having alex tell her 'you may wanna free up that day, cause there is a big BIG surprise
Kiersten kept bugging and bugging him about what it is, and the next day he couldn't hold back anymore cause she was going insane bothering him about it, so he broke her the news
Here was her reaction after alex told her I was gonna be there
(he sent me the convo)  [I can't change the font size on this blog for some odd reason on this computer, but kiersten increased her font on aim to the biggest possible] kiersten1232: SHUT kiersten1232: UP kiersten1232: SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP acewepeel: yessssss kiersten1232: NOO WAY kiersten1232: HOLY kiersten1232: CRAP kiersten1232: OH  kiersten1232: MY kiersten1232: GOD kiersten1232: OH MY GOD OH MY GOD kiersten1232: IM GOING TO CRY kiersten1232: IM ABOUT TO SHED TEARS  acewepeel (11:35:21 PM): then she called me and freaked out some more haha  Funnyboy88 (11:34:57 PM): lol so i hear you heard the news kiersten1232 (11:35:03 PM): AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH kiersten1232 (11:35:20 PM): AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH  The three of us are gonna go to Kennywood on August 7th
Kennywood is a big amusement park, a six flags type of place
I can't wait

So nothing special happened 2day
It was still raining so i couldn't go do my jog and plus i over sleeped
However I did some research to update my sis' laptop
SHe needs a upgrade and i know things like dat so i volunteered to help her update her computer
Ok, my husband and I went last night to see Troy
And after doing some research  a few days before, I noticed a few things from the legend and Hollywood
For one, Helen's husband, Menelaus, was to live according to legend but in the movie, he dies
In legend, Paris dies but not in the movie
Apparently the writer's wanted to keep the 'couple' together and not say with legend
But come on, why should I be surprised?  It's not like this is the first time that Hollywood has changed events to fit what they want
Look at Pocahontas
The Disney movie portrayed her as a young beautiful woman, where as in truth, she was fat ugly and REALLY young
like 10
John Smith, in the movie, young hansom
in truth, 40-ish, bald, short and so on
But back to the movie of Troy, other than the little who dies and who doesn't I was just waiting for Hector played by Eric Bana(aka Bruce Banner
Hulk) to start turning green when he got angry
And Odysseus played by Sean Bean (aka Boromir
Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring)well, with him, it seems like all movies I've seen him in, he dies
But not this one, first movie where he lives
And let's not forget Paris played by Orlando Bloom  (Legolas
LOTR trilogy) can't seem to stay away from a bow
In his first fight scene, can we say wuss
But it was all good
How about a half god, Achilles played by Brad Pitt
Too bad we couldn't see more of his fine butt
But Brad did spin the whole half god thing a new way
He made Achilles more human, a little sensitive
Yeah, he was all for glory, but he also loved his women just as much
LOL   Now off subject
for the past two days, I've been working alot
One of the employees I work with has only been working there for 3 weeks but acts like she manages the place
For instance, it's nonsmoking
She thinks, hey I work alone mostly, all I have to do is use air freshener
Which is wrong
smoking inside is prohibited no matter what
Apparently, she wants to get me fired or something
But I'm hip to her game
But that's not all of it
She gives away merchandise and takes what she wants without paying
Can we say thief?  I've already told Kevin, the manager, that she gives away stuff
But from what I saw yesterday, she paid for it
who's to say that she won't the next time
She says that she pays for the stuff that she takes when she takes it, that I just don't see it
that I'm busy doing other things
So, knowing what I know,  the first thing that I would do if I become manager is fire her for theft
fflkda;lkdjf;alkdjf;alskdjf;alskdfja;slkdfjasl;kdfj;alskdfja;sldkfj;alkdfj;aldkfja;slkdfjasl;kdf
that's my mind thinking
LOL    Here's something else
the stores air conditioning doesn't work
So yesterday and today, I've had to work in heat
Let's just say, fresh air was cool and naturally felt good
But that's beside the point
The point, the AC needs to be fixed   soon
That's all folks
Please walk calmly single file to the nearest exit
Hey all
I just wanted to run an idea past you guys
&nbsp; Would anyone be interested in coming to a party at my house in Brandon the Saturday before school starts?&nbsp; That would be the 28th of August
&nbsp; Umm
leave a comment or a post and let me know what you think and perhaps I will set it into motion
--Ashley M
Ludewig--
As everyone knows, today is el Dia de San Juan
Well, to be honest, I'm assuming that you all know about this special day because I've always known about it
That is, if you consider 'always' to be around 10 o'clock this morning when Glenda, a fellow professor, invited me to her and her husbands house to join them in celebrating this lovely day
Here's the gist of the day: Gather with friends Eat lots o' food Drink lots o' wine Make a fire and burn stuff (What is it with Spaniards and Fire???)  Actually, there's a very special meaning behind all that 'burning stuff'
You're supposed to take a piece of paper, and write a few wishes on it
Things you want to leave behind, things that the fire will burn away (metaphorically)
Or things you want, i
: a million dollars
And when you wake up in the morning, and you look under your pillow, you'll be surprised to find
nothing, because San Juan isn't made of money like our parents always were when we were kids
No, these wishes are basically resolutions and hopes for the next year
And then to show that you have the determination/courage to change the things you want to change, or the intestinal fortitude to follow the dreams you seek, you must jump over the fire
many times
God, I love Spanish culture
So, there I was, half an hour outside of Madrid, in the Spanish countryside
Not a building or streetlight to be seen for miles
And about 12 of us sat around the fire, in Glenda's backyards, under the clear night sky, cheering on each other as we jumped
I whipped out the guitar and serenaded the folk
They actually were impressed that an American could play Spanish music!  Afterwards, I lent my guitar to a senorita at the party, and she and another woman sang us some traditional Spanish music
After we made sure that everyone had gotten a chance to jump (aka: forced if they were being timid), Glenda gave us all a bunch of Rosemary to throw on the fire
It was amazing to see the tremendous amount of reverence each person gave to the power of the flame
Every slip of paper and every twig of rosemary were gently placed into the heaving flames
Every single one of us stopped and stared into the red coals and flickering flames, as we pondered what we just asked for
Respect for the fire
As I was getting a ride back into the city,  I realized that this was the first time in 6 months that I had been out in the countryside as opposed to the city or en-route to another city on a bus/train/etc
Damn, I need to get out of the city more
No, first, I need to find a friend with a car
hehehe
Also, if you're every get the feeling that you don't get out of the house much, let alone the country, just get in your car, or a friend's car, and drive on the highway at night
I don't care what country you're in, but as long as you can't see beyond those 3 lanes, street lights, and roadside McDonald's, at 1AM, they all look the same
I swear, at times, I felt like I was getting a ride back into Hartford
As long as I didn't pay attention to the signs written in Spanish, I could swear I'd see Sisson Ave
coming up on the left at any moment
So, try it next time you're out and about
Impress your friends!  Tell them you were just in Hungary, or Galway, or Denmark, or all three!  Let me know how you're travels go, and how many continents you can hit up in one night
And yes, even the overwhelming amount of construction is the same in other countries
and that memo was so poorly worded
I hate alcohol and I hate drinking
I like drinking, alcohol hates me
One or the other
Sometimes both
My friend, I need a new group of people to hang out with
Good morals, fun-loving, down to earth kind of people
It's not that I don't have friends, but I need to unsubscribe myself from a whole bunch of them
Tired of feeling like shit, tired of going nowhere
Need positive thinking and the like
Very hungry, very much want dragonfish
Where's Yang? Please send ESP message to ms
Yang requesting arrival at house so we can Eat Sushi in mass quantities
Mmmmm Yum! Tired need food can't write must generate brain cells soon
I'm taking advantage of an altogether to brief respite in my incredibly busy life to complain about it
I'm doing too much, and it's driving me insane
I'll skip on the details
But basically, I'm about to find out how much one person can take before he just shuts down
Come spring pops show Wednesday at 7:00
It's the only chance you'll get to see my hip and trendy disco attire
Trust me, you don't want to miss it
My pants are tight and flair at the bottom
It is most humorous
When things cool down and I have time, I'm gonna get my new blog up
It will contain most humorous recaps of my life, leaving this blog for more intelligent discussion
Things cool down around May 30th, btw
The title makes no sense
Don't ask
You invited all my friends! And, in a move that stresses quantity over quality, you also invited all my enemies
Hott  - Rolling out of bed and heading to a Starbucks in a posh part of town wearing no make-up and your pajamas

I am pretty much worried these days
My code is getting bloated to extra ordinary limits and it looks ugly
Its been ages since i last blogged, but i've been SO busy, and all my computer time devoted to Geng Lepas Sekolah
(check the links)  Anyway, about the Star Basketball Tournament, 4th place in my very first tournament! Good? donno la
When it's MY fault we got 4th instead of 1st
Oh well, simple mistakes, we lost the final 2 matches by 1 point each game! How freaking close is that!  so 4th we are
Went to Roger's birthday in the evening, my tuition finished at 7
30 Then my mum decided to go eat steamboat, and so by the time we finished it was 9
00pm what the heck
then when we were going over to Roger's place, we STOPPED at EVERY FREAKING TRAFFIC LIGHT ON THE WAY!! How FRUSTRATING! So I finally reached there at 9
Had a great time though, except they were forcing me to eat food and stuff
Then we decided to visit Boon Tat, living only a few hundred meters away
And guess what? Turns out Roger FORGOT to invite Boon Tat, a person staying only a couple of meters away from HIS HOUSE!! How thick is that?  Anyway, besides Kean Leong expressing interest at every old lady who passed us, it was okay i guess
Ooh and have you EVER seen WENG YIP running? I was laughing and couldnt stand straight!! AHAHAHAAAA  Next day, i found out that our Mercedes is now an AUTO!! looks like i can drive it soon
Speaking of driving, my father let me drive all the way to the barber's today in the Sorento
How cool is that? How many of you get to drive your families around even BEFORE your 16th birthday? How cool is that? although not legally, but still
Great day
Oh yeah i also went to the McD drive-thru
freaking fast service, no sooner had we said our order when it was shoved right at us!! Fast man!! Shmucks!
I figured I'd start me up one of these too! Who knows, maybe someone will read one of my posts some day (yeah, right!)
Bastards!   Outbid by 50p and 30 seconds

com - Kimmel show pulled for comments - Jun 11, 2004   I watched this 'incident' live and didn't think anything of it
Apparently, Kimmel really ticked some people off in Detroit saying that he didn't want them to win because it isn't worth seeing the fans burn the city (I'm paraphrasing)
His reply is classic:   'What I said about Pistons fans during halftime was a joke, nothing more
If I offended anyone, I'm sorry
Clearly, over the past 10 years, we in L
have taken a commanding lead in post-game riots
If the Lakers win, I plan to overturn my own car
'  -- Jimmy Kimmel
I found a blog somewhere that mentioned this article
The New York Times ran it
The headline was 'Lives; When One Is Enough
' Now, let's think about that
What could that possibly allude to? What's the first thing that came into YOUR head when you read it?   I'm guessing that probably what you thought was a little different than what it actually is about
I don't subscribe to the Times (and frankly I'm not planning on it) so when I went to the website I didn't have access to the article
But there was a summary of it that was just as appalling as the story itself:  'The Lives column in The Times Magazine on July 18 gave a first-person account of the experience of Amy Richards, who had been pregnant with triplets and decided to abort two of the fetuses
Richards, who told her story to a freelance Times Magazine contributor, Amy Barrett, discussed her anxiety about having triplets, the procedure to terminate two of the pregnancies and the healthy baby she eventually delivered; she expressed no regret about her decision
'  How would you like to be that kid? Think&nbsp;about it
&nbsp;I don't know what would be worse - growing up knowing your siblings were murdered in your mother's womb right next to you or growing up NOT knowing and then finding out that your mother is the kind of person who would do that to some of her children and not all of them
Either way I would be devastated
Just a thought
Casey is a hazard
She smashed into the wall the other day in English and broke it
A massive bit fell off, and all these wires came out
You hazard you, Casey
I warn you everyone  stay away! * Mwhahaha* Casey likes to 'hide' herself in corners
She curled up at the bottom of one 2day in CS, and Jess and I sat on her
ur a silly thing Casy
See, there u go you got your mention, u happy now? :P Argh
I hate school
I say we should have one day of school, then another 3 weeks of holidays
Now that would be good
Home and Away is on

Alf has got dementure or sumthing, he had a vision of a cloud
But as in a pathetic kinda sad
I mean, come on, as if I could be upset that Alf is physcotic
&nbsp; The storylines are outrageous
Who cares? Obviously not me anymore

Well, I can hardly believe it
&nbsp; Today was my last day of 'freedom' before returning to work after summer vacation
&nbsp; Our summers in Keller are so short
we are only out about seven weeks and I am not quite finished recovering from last semester yet
&nbsp; Tomorrow it is back to the salt mines as they say
&nbsp; I'll have a few weeks to get used to my new kids and new schedules and then my graduate school will begin again!&nbsp; Why am I doing this to myself??&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to work, so that one is a no-brainer, but the grad school thing is just a personal achievement I really want to have
&nbsp; If I didn't have to drive all the way to Denton to attend classes it would not be so bad
&nbsp; Oh well, I guess I will just suck it up and do it anyway!   Scott and David are not at all happy either
They go back next Tuesday

Christmas '02 I am 23 now, and I can't think of anything I want more than just to relax
No big meal, no family
Just mimi, jeremy, leatha and her friend hanging out
We went to lodi to pick up jeremy christmas eve and we opened presents there
I landed a propane stove and light, beard trimmer, a longsleeve shirt with monkeys, and a tree ordament
We came back to the casa is sr and opened more presents with mimi's mom
There I landed a case of Beers around the world
It had twelve different kinds of beers from around the uh world
Very rad
I also got a little red toy vespa, some food stuff for the kitchen, and a beautiful card from mimi that made me cry
I seriously was not in the spirit of getting
I was really enjoying watching everyone unwraping their gifts
I thought that was neat
So anyways, I spent all christmas day working on jeremy's computer
I got it loaded up good now
After that we drove by the santa rosa, healdsburg, and petaluma skateparks to check them over
Very rad
After that I help jeremy with a website and we listened to load music late into the night
Now I have to go to work and do nothing becuase I doubt anyone is gonna be shopping after christmas while it's raining
I did get a call from Legacy Marketing Group and they want to do a face to face interview! Horrrraaayyy!!!
Bob deserves a special mention as he has a had a long hard fight but come out the other side as (say it together) A WINNER
So, Well Done Bob!!!
Congratulations Aya, and well done Daichi! I was quite somewhere-else when this picture was taken

Found out my grandfather passed away a few days ago, which is quite sad and shocking at the same time
I hope he is with my grandmother again in a better place
The  urlLink Friday Five :     Where are you right now?  At home, in front of my computer in my new office
I have the doors wide open, ceiling fans on high and the CD turned up loud
What have you lost recently?  Well, things aren't lost, really
They're just still in boxes
What was the first CD you ever purchased?  Gosh
Madonna?  Does that embarrass you now?  No
I still love her stuff
What is your favorite kind of writing pen?  My favorite pen is a Mont Blanc
Mostly I just use whatever they have at work
What is your favorite ice cream flavor?   urlLink Amy's Mexican Vanilla
Yup this is true they are blocking this! I’ had lot of experience with yahoo (both US and India) and Hotmail (not verified yet) and ISP also doing the same thing
Are they scared of competition?  Read slashdot store  urlLink  here
I voted tonight on my way home
For me, the race for Governor came down to choosing the candidate I believe is the lesser of two evils
Gotta love Texas politics
easy to be cynical, there is a freedom that i can't miss talking about
One that transcends and rocks our existence
but we have to be carefull, this is not a whatever you want to fill in kind of thing
everything screams at us, of bondage
the dog barks, and the man ruins
ruins creation, ruins other people, and ruins himself
its not the only thing he does, but it seems to be one he does rather 'well'
He is totally free to ruin everything around him
but this is the kind of freedom that is like the only thing tieing a man down is the gravity of his his depravity
This is one falling down, and gaining greater and greater volicity just like anything that falls
claw as one might, there is absolutely nothing the falling man can do, since he has not hit anything yet he might even conclude he isn't falling at all, besides, other people are level with him and it seems like they are just floating
sometimes the airball of truth pops from under the water, no matter how hard we supress it
so utterly unable to do anything about it, and ussually ignorant of the real state
The effect of this speeding up life is a cause of a mor horrible then imaginable crash
One infinitely greater than certian death that comes when someone falls from a great hieght in a physical realm
It usually takes some time to understand bondage before you can begin to understand freedom
So I will continue and bring some more analogies and exposition on spiritual bondage first if for only my own edification
Today the Transit of Venus occurred
Not much to look at I'm afraid
This  urlLink Melbourne Observatory  site is worth a look, has information about the 18th and 19th Century Transits of Venus
The  urlLink Airy Transit of Venus Simulator  is not as erotic as it sounds
You search, but you know not what for
You just search
And you wonder whether anyone else remotely contemplates the same things you do, unlike the fellow who goes and names an idea as though he were the only one to ever think of it-- how egotistical! And then you realize that it doesn't really matter, after all
Nothing really matters, and it's not really a bad prospect to live at all
People make it out to sound as though it were a bad thing, something terrible, but it's actually the best thing that could happen to you, to follow that line of thought
And you fear criticism for unknown reasons, since you inadvertenly pour out your own criticism on the unaware's head from day to day, regardless of whether they stop being unaware or continue doing so
You do care then, or do you? Do they, really?  And then another day goes by, and another, and another
And you find yourself, you think, but you don't really
And then you might have
What do you need? Maybe to go back and see what's remote, what's been left behind that you never even knew you had
Will it work? Worth a shot, indeed
Are you sad? No
Are you happy? No
What are you?  'I'm a human, that's what I am!' bellows your head, flapping its internal yap, but it's unheard-well, maybe not completely, but mostly so
But are you really? Or are you just a sheep reincarnated into a human by some mere and odd chance, for neither is related to the other in any earthly nor unearthly way? Well, I suppose they could be related, somehow
Still, I maintain I didn't come from monkeys nor sheep
Sometimes I wonder where I came from, and that's supposedly a shame, a sin
Why? Insecurity is frightening very often, but then, it opens your mind to everything, and that's not so bad a thing
It can be unpleasant, however, particularly when you're so open-minded that you're not sure what you should believe in
And then you're in trouble
There again, who cares? It's amazing how you can go to sleep and think, 'You know, I might never wake come tomorrow, mate,' but then, if you do know for a fact that you won't, in fact, awaken, suddenly it does matter
It matters a lot, and it's not all right anymore
Sometimes I think I'm really selfish and nonappreciative, and you know what? I am
But it's normal
It's human nature to want something
It's often inadvertent, but that's why I'm not God
Mizar's waiting on me
Dear Sonority,  How's it going? i went bowling and chilled at west bowl yesterday after training, before returning home to watch the match of this season! hehs, if you have no idea what am i blabbering about, it's the rugby world cup finals between aussie and england! england won  20 - 17

The sad truth is that this small site could in fact be the best resource for ending the Gender war than any other 'Man's Lib', 'father's rights' or 'Male Pride' site on the internet at the moment
That is not pride, just the sad conclusion that has driven this site into being
We will aim to cover the issues one by one in depth and properly
We will examine relevant news when it occurs and provide a regular digest of the facts for our readers
We aim to provide every link and resource necessary for campaigners and researchers to get to the bottom of the issues
As you may have noticed, my post titles have been in a sort-of 'The Goat, or Who Is Sylvia?'-type format (and that's an oddball play
i only used it for reference
It helps me to cover multiple topics
Yesterday, I made my long overdue stop at Barnes and Noble, and picked up some assigned reads that will actually be enjoyable
Although I must say, now that I've read 7 more pages of 'Dune', I'm considering reconstructing it's formerly-charred-hectagonal-vertices (see post below)
I can live with it
To continue, I purchased 'A Walk Across America', about a man who decides to walk across America
Hence the title
I also bought 'Hiroshima', and 'Days of Grace', Arthur Ashe's memoir
I wanted to pick up 'I Me Mine', and I even was interested in David Sedaris's new book, but I was limited to my purchases
I have gone swimming every day this week for atleast an hour
Pruny-finger-mania
And I thought I'd have more to say about the Endless Swim, but I don't
Float on, y'all
The budget is out and with it all the reviews and analysis
I am yet to get into the details and by the caution the market has shown by diving down on hearing about the tax proposal, I think this budget might have something peculiar
The Education cess is a good idea, but as is always said, the problem is not the lack of money but the efficient use of it
So, if Mr
Chidambaram can find some ways to use it efficiently, that would spell success to India
actual things spoken by members of my family today   'wow, there are  a lot  of shoes in here!'--my mother, after walking into a gigantic shoe outlet store  'ok, who wants to be handcuffed!?'--my 10-year-old nephew, screaming, after opening up some army toyset my dad bought him in a futile effort to get him to settle down  'holy shit, i can't believe he's going straight for the half-pipe!'--my dad, as we stood and watched my nephew try out his skills at a nearby vans skatepark
we essentially spent the whole day there, where there are empty swimming pools and ramps and railings
i'm sure all these things have official names i don't know despite my love for all things x-games (they start august 16, yay!)
he fell a lot, which i expected
what i didn't expect was how he kept trying and falling and trying and falling
there's no way i would ride a skateboard into a 10-foot deep swimming pool
unless there was water in it
then, maybe
there's an eight-year-old girl who hangs out at the skatepark who is an absolute prodigy
i've seen her there before and i was pretty excited when i saw her arrive today
i could watch this kid skate all day
in ten years, she'll be on the circuit or whatever it's called
seriously
i wish i had been that good at something other than masturbating when i was eight years old
the girl is my idol
and, my nephew is totally in love
Busy summer for me
I've got two books to finish up before the end of the season -- both adaptations (one movie, one anime) -- and, yet I'm still going to be at Wizardworld Chicago from August 13-15
I'll be the tired-looking guy sharing the booth with RCHarvey (famed cartoonist)
We'll be number 9071-A (unless the con folk change their minds)
Drop by and say 'Hi!'  This will be my  only  convention appearance this summer
(Or for the rest of the year, probably
) Since they moved GenCon out of Milwaukee, I just can't drive down for the day at the drop of a hat
If they ever move it back, I'll probably start going again
I've got a lot BIG NEWS from the last couple of months
I've had three books (two paper, one electronic) come out since June:  Thunderbirds (the novelization of the new movie) The Dying Kingdom (my first YA Dragonlance book -- and second in the series) Carnival/Circus (two short stories -- available at  urlLink www
lonewolfpubs
com )  They're all good work, and you should check them out if you get a chance
The Thunderbirds book even includes some material that didn't make the 'final cut' in the movie
The movie is good, by the way, though a bit more fast-paced than I would have prefered
(I'd liked to have lingered on some of the scenes, dialog, and SFX -- to enjoy them -- longer than they chose to
But, hey, I'm not a filmmaker
)  It was a strange experience seeing a movie of a book I 'wrote,' and it's odd writing adaptations to begin with
Once I get done with an adaptation, I feel like I 'own' the story -- almost like I created it
Of course, it originated with someone other than me
And the original screenwriters will probably never meet, or even hear of me
Still, it's fun and challenging work turning a screenplay into a book
The two disciplines are quite different, and each have their own strengths and weaknesses
With my writing style, which is highly cinematic anyway, it's probably not so tricky for me as it might be for some
And, of course, I'm trying to turn out a damn good book each time, despite the fact that it's work-for-hire and not really 'mine
'  The other BIG NEWS is that I won the Origins Award again
This time, for Best Game Related Fiction, Short Form
Last time it was for 'long form' with my final L5R novel, THE LION
(Still available!) The story that won was the Mage Knight opus, PODO &amp; THE MAGIC SHIELD

Time to get back to work!  -- Steve Sullivan
War Torn Love – By Jill Wakefield  Katherine stared into the white face of the old pocket watch, ten 'til nine it read
She then looked up to the north corridor entrance across the grand hall of the station
She sighed as she watched holiday shoppers bustling about with soon-to-be gifts in their hands
Murmurs and the occasional cry of a child filled the tile and marble hall
Amidst the constant echoes she felt strangely alone at the café
Katherine's weariness was beginning to gnaw at her anxiousness and excitement as she waited
She adjusted her stiff and fatigued body in the small wooden chair as she thought to herself: 'He’s three hours late now'
Katherine pulled her shawl closer to her as she sat waiting
She would wait there all night for him if necessary
She began to dread that this delay might not be that he simply missed his train but that his letter of decommission came too soon
What if he was never able to escape eastern France?  What if he died from the injuries he had mentioned in earlier letters?  She had counted the long months and cherished every letter from her husband since he was sent off to war in Europe
For once she had developed an intimate relationship with their regular mailman, always hoping he would bring some good news
When the letter finally came that he was being honorably discharged due to injury her happiness overran any thoughts about his condition
What if he died as he was being transported to the states? Honestly, Katherine had always felt that he was unsuited for this trial and feared it would take his life
He was a gentle man, always tender even to strangers
He was not timid nor a coward but the horrors of this war seemed more than any sensitive soul could handle
Katherine had more than once wrapped herself in her own arms as she read the news about Hitler's ravaging army in occupied east Europe and France
In her dreams she had seen her fair Benjamin fall to his knees in horror as he stood upon the blood soaked ground
The fact that her mind could conjure up such images was frightening
A touch on her shoulder brought her back to the cold Grand Central Station
It was the elderly waiter
He informed her that the café would be closing shortly
He welcomed her to sit at the small table as long as she liked but urged her to order anything else now
She smiled faintly and checked her small purse
She had hoped to treat her husband to a warm meal with her newly hard earned money but now she saw fit to have one more cup of coffee in an effort to help her stay awake
The kindly old man nodded her request to a young serving boy and then walked over to another gentleman who was waiting at a far table
Katherine noticed how the bearded man also ordered a coffee with what coins he had in his pocket
Katherine had noticed him when she first sat down
She couldn't imagine whom he was waiting for in such a disheveled state
He wore a hat down tight on his head, complimented with a tattered long coat and extra large scarf
She had no choice to arrive in her office clothes and her hair was falling down out of the bun she had made this morning, but she still thought of herself as presentable
Katherine soon realized her own arrogant thoughts and scolded herself
Times were hard nowadays
Many people didn't have much and were too often starving
‘This man was probably spending what he has on food at the cost of his appearance’, she thought to herself
She smiled faintly to apologize for her rude thoughts
The man reacted strange to her awareness of him
As her cup of coffee arrived Katherine turned her gaze back to the grand hall and the far north corridor
Another half an hour went by and the crowds had begun to decrease
Not many were traveling at night
Most of the travelers earlier had been women
Though many American housewives had taken up a job in the past two years most still clung to their old ideas and values
One of them was to be home before too late
Katherine had believed in these womanly rules too
Working for a local department store had helped her manage the household affairs but she had to get use to coming home to an empty house in the evening
It was disturbing for her those first months
She found herself praying every night not only for Benjamin's safety but also for strength to carry on with his normal duties
Just then she noticed a chair being pulled over to her table
It was the shaggy gentlemen
'May I sit down with you Madam?  If we could find company with one another we would not have to wait alone
If you don't find me too gruesome, of course
' he said in a shy and soft voice
At this moment Katherine was able to see him much clearly as she looked up into his face
She saw that he wore a tattered military coat and hat, but what startled her was his face
Beneath his hairy features was much scarring, especially on the left side of his face
The left eye seemed pale like rotten milk, most likely blinded
His hand in which he grasped the chair was missing the last two fingers and knuckles of others
It too was scarred but functioning at best as it held the back of the chair
She recognized that he must be another decommissioned soldier
His torn features did send a shiver down her back but her kind heart went out to him
I would enjoy the company, Sir
Please pardon my reaction
You simply startled me,” she said politely and inviting
He, of course, already knew what had happened but was desperately thankful for her tender entreaty
He had been watching her for sometime now, ever since she arrived and began waiting
He had watched as she took out the golden pocket watch, how she caged it in her slender pale fingers
He had counted each chestnut brown strand of her hair as it fell loose from her bun and began to frame her face
‘It was such a beautiful face’, he had thought
With hearing her kind words in his good ear he almost wept
Her fidelity in waiting up to this late hour finally stirred enough strength in his heart to approach her
'Who is it that you're waiting for Miss?' he asked
Hansen
I'm waiting for my husband who is home from the war in Europe
Were you there, Sir?' she asked timidly, not wanting to upset him
The man took a deep breath into his lungs before answering
He seemed to be quelling something
'Yes, Mrs
Hansen, I have seen that land and it has seen me,' he said in a sad tone
Katherine nodded not wishing to ask him more and have him recall any pain
Silence took over the table again as the two sipped their coffee
A desperate question had been pushing at the man ever since he saw her sit down and soon he felt that question boiling up to his lips
He was scared of her answer
So much seemed to be resting on it
Hansen, may I beg of you to answer a sensitive and possibly disturbing question?' he asked very softly as he covered his bad left hand with his normal right hand
Katherine was taken aback by the sudden change in conversation
She felt trapped by her feelings to be kind to the man so nervously she agreed to the strange request
'You don't need to pretend Madam
I know my appearance is more than startling
What I have been waiting for here in this café is to learn whether or not I can come home looking as I do
I want to know if I can be accepted and loved like any other man - like the man I was before
You're a tender and kind young woman, who I'm sure, is loving and sweet
Could you see a woman not unlike yourself loving a man who looks as I do?' he asked almost shaking with those last words
Katherine looked into his eyes deeply and swallowed
She struggled with an answer for such a question
She looked back to the north corridor and thought of her own Benjamin
‘What if those injuries he spoke of were similar to this man's’ she thought
Of course she would continue to love him in her heart but to feel comfortable
it would be very hard to find comfort in the visage of a battle torn man
She had always loved Benjamin’s handsome looks
She couldn’t imagine them gone, but she did know that what she loved most of all about him was his wit and kindness
It was his tender carefree nature that had always stirred her passion
She instantly recalled a time when they were walking in Central Park and happened upon a large muddy road
He had attempted to carry her over it but slipped and both fell into the sludge
At first she was upset and glowing like a boiling kettle, but then Benjamin began laughing and it was infectious
She was soon giggling as they threw mud at each other
They looked like a pair of dirty bums as they walked home but the joy was there nonetheless
Though mud cannot compare to carnage, she felt love would overcome the aftermath of war
Finally, she replied to the soldier
'Sir, I will not lie to you
Your looks are more than startling
In fact they hamper my response
But thinking of my own dear Benjamin
I realized he too could return looking much like yourself
So much in fact that I might not recognize him, fore I can’t imagine him in such a state
Although, the sight of him would at first be frightening, and sadness would grip us both, I'm sure our love will spark during that first awkward embrace
No matter what the war has done to him, he will always be my Benjamin inside
I know I would be able to look on him and see his love shining through, making him more dear to me than ever
' she said as she started to glow for the first time that night
Her words brought tears to eyes of the soldier
With his good hand he wiped them away
At that moment the man reached into his pocket and pulled out a folded up handkerchief and offered it to her
Katherine wasn't sure what to make of it until she unfolded it
Inside was a locket
This was the same locket she exchanged for her dear Benjamin's pocket watch
They had agreed to exchange these items while he was away during this war
'What does this mean?' she cried shaking with fear, tears of having lost her beloved husband were already forming in her eyes
'It means, my sweet Katherine, that your dear Benjamin has come home
' he said as he choked on more of his own tears
Before her gaping eyes he removed the tight hat and scarf
Katherine stared and slowly she saw her Benjamin under the thin, pale, scruffy, and scarred soldier before her
She began to cry as she reached out for him with shaking hands
Her lips trembled as she brought his good hand close them
Her touch was like an angel's
Benjamin wanted to embrace her with all his might, but he was still afraid her reaction
He couldn’t bear to see her shocked gaze
Katherine felt shattered by love and grief as she looked upon her husband
The tears wouldn’t stop but the love in her swelled and shaking as much as him, she stood holding both his good and bad hands gently urging him to stand with her
As they both stood crying in sadness and joy she reached her arms around his neck and hugged him as she kissed his scarred cheek
Feeling his own love for his dear sweet Katherine over powered him
Benjamin scooped her up into his arms and spun around on both good and bad legs
Oh how he had wanted to hold her high, to show her that he still could
They simply stood holding one another as the last station officer peered at them from a distant doorway
The old man shed a tear himself as he left them to their war torn love - still thriving
If you read my last post, you know that I’m a big fan of Bill Nye (the Science Guy) who appeared on CNN a few days ago to tell the viewing public about  The Day After Tomorrow —the film that depicts the world ending a few days thanks to global warming—and how there is no way the events portrayed would happen so quickly
But Bill said something that didn’t ring true, though it’s one of those things that “just seems right” to most people but doesn’t actually work that way
Bill is deeply concerned about the state of the planet and the speed in which we are using our natural resources
So, he advised us to stave off disaster by using fewer of them—Bill apparently rides his bike everywhere to save on gasoline
While this seems like the perfect solution to combat global warming, because of the way the economy works it is far from being true
Using fewer fossil fuels drives down their price and creates less incentive for creating cheaper, renewable substitutes
Our economy is large and free enough to sustain legions of entrepreneurs to offer new options when the old ways become too expensive
During the California energy crisis a few years ago, the price of oil skyrocketed and the renewable energy industry boomed as firms invested in solar panels and wind energy
Riding your bike to save money or get exercise is one thing (because these are internal benefits that are the natural response of market activity); riding it to save the environment is another (because it is in pursuit of an external benefit that cannot be measured and, therefore, actually hinders the creation of a solution to the greenhouse problem)
Using more gasoline to get off of it doesn’t make sense to a lot of people but over the course of human history, when one resource gets too expensive, we find substitutes for it
Metals, for example, are always cited as something we will run out and then we’ll be screwed, even though more and more building materials are made from plastics
There’s no reason to think that gasoline is any different
And because we have every reason to believe that we will be richer and more knowledgeable in the future than we are today, we can depend on the fact that our new energy source will be much cleaner than gasoline
Our wealth will allow us to express the new knowledge in new inventions
So let’s not succumb to scare tactics that emphasize short term effects, like riding bikes
Let’s have the courage to look at the big picture and resist the temptation to trade in our car for a ten speed
And I thought The Bachelor was  urlLink bad
Guitar strings  These things
are bastards
I had to change one over today as I was a little too violent when playing some power chords
This then led to a 1/4 of an hour of me scratching my head going
'How do I
?' Before deciding to suck up my pride and ask
This then led to a period of relative joy
before realising that i had spent 5 minutes fumbling like a gibbon trying to get the string to wrap around the top of the guitar
fifteen mionutes and several cut fingers later I had myself a fully tuned working guitar again
Note to everyone
don't break guitar strings
they're a bastard to change
yes  Laters

TERESSA KERRY IS AFRICAN AMERICAN   But not black
According to Mrs
Kerry, because she grew up in Africa she's African American
But, if you'll notice, there's a difference in her African American and the other African-American
The hyphen's missing in her meaning
That's right, Mrs
Kerry says that  African-American  belongs to blacks, but  insists that it's proper to call herself African American as long as no hyphen is used or intended
'My roots are African,'  she told a reporter in 1995
'The birds I remember, the fruits I ate, the trees I climbed, they're African
'   This is the best thing I've ever heard
Even though she grew up amidst segregated privilege in colonial Mozambique, and that she's African American, she really hasn't helped 'her people'
Beside giving money to the Save The Children Fund, she really hasn't donated much of her vast fortune to Mozambique
She has nearly a quarter of Mozambique's annual Gross Domestic Product and she can't donate to her 'homeland'
I wonder if people like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton will eventually jump on this?  If Bush were to say he were Mexican American because he was raised in Texas, people would shit their pants calling him a racist
But I doubt anyone even mentions this in the next 9 months
The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing
wow what a long time since i have last spoken my words to you all
thjats cause i almost lost my fingers in a sad mowing/figure skating accident but luckily they were sowen back on
So a lot has happened since i last have spoken
First off, we got through Euro
ok enought talking/speakibng about that shit class for the rest of my life
School is only 1 day away from being finished
THANK GOD and another god i worship, sarah the goddess of love
Today i started a new processes in my life called- expanding my web and phasing out any of my old friends that are girls in particular andrea martinson
O wait, thats just what she thought i was doing cause i didnt sit with the usual people at lunch today
but then we realized i didnt sit there cause the entire friggen school had the same lunch
So, soccer has been going well, if any of you are wondering
We are like 0-10000 but hey were doing well
we have a game on WEDNESDAYW at 7 at oak park so you should all be there or i will haze you all by making u drink, run outside in the rain, suck down twinkies, make u suck a raw bratwords, and kick you endless
o and ill also get caught and get a ticket for DWI and get expelled from highschool (o wait thats not me)
anyways, im the popularist guy in the group, big ass titties bitches think im cute
and im out
Weight:  According to the gym scales, about the same, but the guy took off three kilos for clothes
Height: According to the gym, I'm about the same (1
72m)  Aerobics was good last night
Managed to squat sucessfully and hold for four (which was more like six by the time she started counting!!)  Stiff neck this morning
Still no time table
Went and saw Dirk, he wasn't aware that he was filling in for the guy who was filling in for the Honours Co-ordinator who was out somewhere for the week
Dirk suggested I send an email to the guy filling in for the Honours Co-ordinator
I have just sent my first Monash based email from my new Monash email address
Yay!  In the case of failure I am to turn up at 11:00 and classes are mostly Mondays and Thursdays
I could cope with that kind of starting time
I am annoyed because yesterday I could get the music to work on Dave's pc and now it just doesn't
It says it's playing and nothing is coming out
I checked volume (in two places), I checked the tape thing says 'CD'
What more can there be?  Today I was walking through uni (feeling discouraged after failing to find out about time table) when I saw this poster  Are the educated less racist?  Or something like that
I thought, oh, that sounds controversial, I could write about that on my blog
Then I thought that it would come to do 'what is racism' and 'what makes us racist'
So I decided to take an Epicurean point of view
Basically, Epicurus holds that desires/emotions that we have that are not natural and necessary (e
not eating, breathing) are based on false beliefs
For example, we believe that fame is important because of false beliefs about what it is to be mortal
We (they) believe that we should be good because otherwise the gods will punish us, but this fear of the gods is false (the gods don't give a rats what we do, because they're so perfect, how could little us affect them?)  So in the case of racism the false belief is that people of another race are going to do you harm
(Now, this was probably just a bit true if you were an Athenian or a Roman
)    Now it has been observed (not just by watchers of sesame street) that children aren't racist
Racism is something we learn
So we learn to be afraid of other races, then we learn (through further education, I presume the askers of the question are postulating) that we learn that they're not that scary at all
After all, most 'educated' folks think that racism is based on ignorance
It is possible to have be educated and ignorant though
(Educated and elitist, if you are Plato or Aristotle - there philosophy wasn't for the farmers, women or slaves because they didn't have time
)  Anyway, no real point, just thought it was interesting
Invention for the day: Telepathy that allows communication between members of a department and automatically generates (and sends out to students) a time table
These here are just a few songs that I enjoy listening to at the moment I hope this adds up to something of value to you people

Hope you can still sort of figure it out
It was such a gloomy day outside that it made for a really gloomy day inside and bad picture taking qualities!&nbsp; urlLink
I'm just going out to chill with Jo, have a chat etc, see a film, i'm still knackered though, but oh well, saw Jason and Laura, but not together so thats ok, i haven't seen them together yet and i don't want to, not going to bother talking about it

urlLink Steve , a 3L at Ohio State, shares some bad interview advice for 2Ls
My favorite is number three: 'Never, ever stop talking
'  The post right below his interview advice post talks about how he found out one of his professors reads his weblog, and then she asked him about his summer, 'before realizing that she already knew how it went
'  I find that it's of course neat in a lot of ways to find out that people I know read this thing, and, maybe even more so, people I really don't know
But it does kind of leave me with a little bit less to say in person -- I worry a bit that I'm a letdown if someone reads faithfully
I feel a bit of pressure to be 'on,' to be funny, to be make up new weblog posts on the spot, or I'll be considered an imposter
Sort of
Not really
Just reading Steve's post made me reflect on that a bit
I met a 1L last week at an orientation event who reads this, and I started saying something, and one of my friends I'd been talking to said that it sounded like all of a sudden I was doing 'shtick
'  Which I guess I kind of was
Kudos to whoever manages  urlLink this site   I dont know much about carnatic music, just begun to appreciate it and if there's anyone out there who wants to listen to some examples for Alapana of a particular raga, Neraval, Swarakalpana, that is the place
I intend to replicate this library locally
I hope they dont mind
The quality of the recording is bad, but not a hindrance to learn
This is a vocabulary an  improvement attempt
At times it is necessary to improve vocabulary to communicate with (and get doubts answered from) people who understand the Jargon

Have i got a story to tell
Way too long to post here, but it has to do with Michael
If anyone's interested, call me and I'll tell the story
SIGN THE GUESTBOOK   Thank you to those of you who already have
Yeah, that's only two of you
I gave this address to more people that that
Do you ever find yourself getting lost in the beauty of things
Perhaps it's just my romantic side, but just the same
Yesterday I had some great music going, and I felt like drawing- so I took this rose I got on Thursday for V-Day, and put it on my windowsill
This was just after the sun had set
And so I drew it, though the drawing doesn't do it justice
after it started getting to twilight (mind you, I've got this thing for twilight
best time of day), and I had a light pointed at it
It was
striking
Contrast of color and all that
it just struck me
Gave me chills
So, you know, I ended up staring at it until I realized it was dark
And then these incredible stars showed up outside my window
Venus, I can always see from my window
That wonderful bright blue twinkling
I guess it's the simple stuff that gets me
When I'm in the right mood
:) I should've been doing my homework
*Shrug* Sometimes you have to make sacrifices for, erm, a greater good
urlLink    This is Dolly, my oldest friend

After handing in my essay I continued to work on The Shirt
The Shirt is a lovely piece of fabric I managed to get the bolt-end of at Lincraft (who have nice mid range fabrics that they charge too highly for)which has printed flowers on a stark white background as well as some white thread embroidery
It is a crisp, stiff white too and while you may be thinking Laura Ashley (erk) it's a little more contemporary than that
In my quest for all that is not mass produced (and therefore meaningless), I've started applying it to my sewing techniques as well as the clothes I make
Generally when you have a pattern, you pin it to your fabric and then with chalk or a special pen, mark out all the dots (that tell you where other pieces match up), and darts
In that past I have just stabbed the thin paper away with a pin then rubbed in the chalk, removed the pattern and continued on, but its somewhat inaccurate and (I felt) gave my clothes that 'just learned to sew' look
So instead I followed the French and instead of that I used tailors tacks
It simply means I used doubled thread to mark all these things, but instead of drawing I sewed through all the layers with big loops which I cut when done and separated everything
I was rewarded with spot on accuracy for all my markings!  Hooray!  Tell most sewers (bar dressmakers and tailors) you use this method and they will think you are  crazy  because it takes so much longer
But I've always preferred the long way to the quick and dirty
Anyway upon congratulating myself for this, I discovered I'd run out of another fabric necessary to make the shirt
Another reward - I get to to go fabric shopping tomorrow!  Yes, you just got a whole post about sewing
Go read someone elses blog I am boring atm and loving it
I've eaten two bowls of indomie noodles today, mee goreng and b-something goreng (satay)
My mouth is burning beautifully!
I was up all night, and in my half-sleep I started thinking about giving up
Is there a difference between quitting (being a quitter) and just conceding that there are some things I am not cut out to do well?  I like to win, I like to be the best, and I like to seem in control
I also really like cookies with chocolate chips and pecans
I don't like to make decisions for myself, I don't like failing, and I don't like being underappreciated
And I really don't like being laughed at
I enjoy quilts and crisp sheets
I don't like bath gels that smell like fruit -- I hope I don't get any for Christmas
Mmm, the smell of buttermilk
But not to wear
I don't want to smell like food
I've spent too much time working in restaurants
I hate listening to cars drive on wet streets
I saw somebody I knew from a while ago walking down the Parkway, but I couldn't remember her name in time to say hello
I actually didn't recognize her until I thought about it later, and I'm glad I didn't say hi to her because I'm pretty sure we were on bad terms when we knew each other
I think
I've been watching too many television specials about Britney Spears
But they are fascinating, she's a card
Actually they make me feel good about myself
I would like to be a performer, but only for one day
Okay, two or three (weeks?)
The world should perhaps be glad I'm talent-less
Oh, I got something I wanted just by asking, and I didn't even have to explain myself
I can't decide whether this is a good thing, because I'm now afraid that he'll change his mind once he realizes why I expected him to say no
No need to worry about that just yet, I suppose
4 Days Vacation in Cagayan   hi!Ü I just learned sometime ago that OT means 'out of topic'
Ü  so there's a reason why you are brought to this page
but i do know that you came here because you want the truth
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth
so help me God!  iniwi, spontaneity
that's my goal today
i just want to write anything that comes across my mind
so right now, just so you will know, i'm pissed! i'm soooo pissed out because i already had this composition! and f**k! the computer restarted without even nudging me and i wasn't able to save it and here i am! i have to write things all over again and it spoiled everything! (OT: our electric fan stand looks like a driving wheel) my main reason why i'm here is to share to you my 4 days vacation in cagayan
Ü  so let me start by telling you a story about a girl
standing in a front of a boy, asking him to love her
familiar?Ü yes my friend
i came back here with a purpose
i came here to make a change
i came here with a specific agenda
i came
to follow my heart
i came here
hahaaay! to bring him back
yeah, you got me there
i want him back
period
no what ifs
no buts
so zip it! and well of course, i miss my family real bad! i gotta spend time with them!  'i know who i want to take me home! i know who i want to take me home! i know who i want to take me home! take me home! closing time, every new beginning comes from some other beginning's end
' -Semisonic  perhaps there are reasons why, maybe
i'm tired of night life
i'm tired of discos
i'm tired of billiards
i'm tired of drinking
i'm tired of dating guys (and i can't force myself to like them anyway)
boils down to the main reason
which is
i'm tired of buying happiness
it's a waste of money
it's a waste of time
it's a waste of effort
it gives me eyes bugs
and it makes me look uglier and uglier and uglier every freaking day
and i'm sick of that
so screw everything! leme come back here
and do my thang
Ü  saturday mission:  i called him up
he's in red ribbon
he's eating there
with somebody
his girlfriend? yes his girlfriend
he's got a girlfriend
i broke down
i cried
to make the story short
my plan crumbled
so what to do now? i have to get the hellouta my bed!  so my night life started again
i went out to meet some friends in the night cafe
hej, guy1, guy2, guy3 and gaston
Ü  let me tell you what i usually do when i'm in a real deep shit
'got introduced to you by a friend
and you were cute and all that baby you set the trend yes you did oh
and next thing i know we're down at the cinema, we're sittin' there and you start kissin' me what's that about???' -M2M  i wish!!!Ü sorry po
no kissin
Ü wala lang
naghang out lang mi
they were just friends
so all they did was actually comfort me by listening to my endless incantations, by sitting there and drinking with me
they suggested i should hang myself
or maybe jump off carmen bridge
maybe try to drink some poison
or perhaps slash my wrist
the best suggestion i got was
try all that in one time! coooooooooooooool!Ü but nah
(OT: nitext sha! his message? 'GOD is the reason why
even at the saddest part of life, we SMILE; even in confusion, we UNDERSTAND; even in betrayal, we TRUST; and even in fear of pain, we LOVE
')  i said nah
because i started to like gaston
considering the state that i was in, i should probably brush it away and think of it as a dream? i don't know
really
i won't deny that i easily fall for a guy
but it's different with him because he makes me wanna forget my ex
Ü and any guy can never have that effect on me in one snap! hell, he did
and darn it! he's younger than me! shoot me
shoot me now! i'm sorry- shoot me later
i'm not done yet
to proceed
i'm not at all worried if ever he'll reach this page
wala man shai friendster
hehehehe! Listen to me talking to myself…  “you shouldn’t fall for him sashi! he only thinks you’re using him because he knows you love your ex and besides you told him yourself that you have that tendency
When you’re heartbroken, you tend to divert your feelings to another person… and what do you think does that say? Eh?”  “I know
I know
I know! It was wrong for me to say that to him
Darn it! But it’s the truth! That’s what usually happens… but I don’t think this is a diversion, maybe a little… because even before, even BEFORE, I like him already
Remember during Joel’s birthday? Remember the time you went to his house? Remember when you ate V-cut with Joel and him in his room? Remember the time when he got his new celfone and you sent him logos? Remember how you feel so happy every time he texts you? And you can’t do anything about it… just because you have a boyfriend
And he’s your boyfriend’s bestfriend… and you don’t want to hurt Joel? Remember all those things?”  “Good point
Yes, I do remember all those things… But what else can you do now? He doesn’t know what’s on your mind at all
And he thinks you’re only using him to mend a broken heart
That could be the reason why he dint text back
The reason why his last message was just that above
The reason why he’s a stone
The reason why he tried not to be affected by you
”  “Yeah, maybe maybe
But I can’t do anything now
I know that
I just wish I could go back and change anything and let things flow ‘normally’… I wish I hadn’t told him that my way of attacking situations like this is to divert my attention to another person
Bad move
”  Anyway, I have to go na
Chatting with baby pawi online
So NOW, you can shoot me
ciao friend!

I just came across this news article on CNN
I am usually a huge advocate for all technological advances, but this is just wrong
urlLink Article   To paraphrase:  Some guy has filed a patent for video-equipped touchscreen talking tombstones
Imagine walking through a cemetary where you can literally see each person on a video display talking?  That would be way too freaky for me
Consider this fact:   [the] percentage of students who describe themselves as liberal has increased significantly over the last year — from 36 percent to 44 percent   This is from an excellent NYT  urlLink article   about how 9/11 has affected the political imaginations of todays college students
I knew this was going to happen
I predicted it on 9/11
I was still fairly conservative then, albeit an anti-war conservative
I knew that there is nothing like war to turn young people (esp
the smarter ones) against conservative policies
Dear Hummer-driving Financial District Douchebag Who Almost Hit Me:  I was really enjoying my nice afternoon walking around the majestic streets of Downtown San Francisco--that is, before you nearly flattened me with your big, cheesy H2 road tank
First of all--despite what you might have seen in the various Hummer commercials--there really is no 'rocky, muddy or mountainous terrian' here in San Francisco
You're not going to need to navigate through boulders, snow or really any other excessively difficult physical environment
We've got fog
And the fog is going to be a pain in the ass whether you're a brand new Hummer or an '89 Celica
No, this is a CITY which means pretty much everything here is PAVED, hence--the 90 inch radials are a bit uneccessary, don't you think?  I'm not sure whether or not you know that oil prices are now over 40 dollars a barrel, or that we're in a worldwide CRISIS (not to mention a war)--I imagine you probably don't really give a flying fuck
No, as long as you've access to the shopping mall, Justin Timberlake music (which you were so flagrantly blaring) and 'Friends' reruns, you probably don't really mind shelling out the $80 it required to fuel up your roadhog
Now, douchebag, here's where things get personal
I was walking down the street, minding my own business, when you whip around the corner--going way too fast--then slam on the breaks in avoid mowing me down
THEN you flip ME off, incredulous that I could put MY BODY in the way of YOUR HUMMER
I'm sorry, Mr
Douchebag--I know you were probably in a hurry to get your pubic hair waxed or something, but I just didn't see you roadbeast coming
So, after you 'peeled out' and blazed past me, I'd barely had the chance to turn around when I heard the brutal, unmistakable sound of concrete crushing metal
I guess maybe you were going too fast, maybe you were just too into the JT song or maybe you were overwhelmed by excitement about getting your shit waxed
I don't know
But THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU for not seeing the sign on the parking garage than read 'Maximum Height 7 Feet'--watching you completely fuck up the roof of your stupid Hummer has been the highlight of my week
Instant Karma's gonna get ya', Alex C
Many news outlets are running with a  urlLink story  about four people killing six other people over the theft of an Xbox and some clothes
The four killers, armed with aluminum baseball bats, forced their way into the home where the victims were in beds early Friday morning, and beat them to death -- just as Victorino planned, Johnson said
I suppose headlines such as 'Xbox killers' and 'Sheriff: 4 charged in Florida killings over Xbox' make for sexy copy but what really happened is that, allegedly, a bunch of thugs killed people who were asleep in bed
The fact that an Xbox was misappropriated is tangential to the larger story
While I'm sure I would see red if someone stole my game console, I don't think I would feel justified in beating the perpetrator to death with a baseball bat
You have to understand that I own a PS2 and play Grand Theft Auto quite a lot
If I want to beat someone to death with a bat, I'll do it in the game
(Cue: New call for more strict regulation of violent video games
wait for it
)  What about a comprehensive 'assault bat' ban? I mean, you can't tell me that those aluminum bats are useful for hunting
bunting
Bats don't kill people, stolen video games kill people
Personal responsibility, anyone? Anyone? Bueller?
It is currently +23C headed for a high of +26C!  Wow, I think maybe *crosses fingers* summer might be here
Well definitely spring anyways
I like this time of year, for the most part
I don't like the dead trees and brown grass, and dust and dirt, but the longer days and nicer weather are sure a lot better for a person's morale than winter :P  As I sit here waiting for the 1st coat of nailpolish on my toes to dry (a colour called Typhoon, it's kinda blue, but it shines a purply colour), I am getting excited about what this summer is going to bring
I just look forward to having a job, and NOT having to do homework
Being able to spend my non-working time just relaxing with my friends and family, and not worrying about this exam, or that assignment
I look forward to doing a lot of summery things this summer
Jay and I were planning to do some touristy Saskatoon things, maybe hit up some museums, the zoo and whatever else our little hearts desire
I hope to have some slurpees (I haven't had one in ages!), spend some good quality time in the patio swing soakin up some rays and I would like to get to the lake (and it doesnt really matter which one
) sometime this summer, all depending on the work situation
I am a little bit scared about being dumped out on my butt in the real world, but the excitment of having a career and not just a summer job outweighs the scariness for me!    I was remembering this time last year when I was planning to move out of my parents house
It would have been good for me I'm sure, however, I would now be in a position that a couple of people in my class are in
Get a job by July 1st or end up moving back to mom and dad's house
I think that this has all worked out for the best in the long run
I still look forward to being able to move out and be independant, but I know that for now, saving money and trying to get myself a car is what I need to do
I sure do suck at painting my toenails
I got just about as much polish on my toes as I do on my nails
But it usually comes off with the first shower, so it should be alright
I think today I might go and look at some new sandals
I have had my Reebok sport sandals since high school (over 6 years ago!) and they are not in bad shape, except for the complete lack of tread left on the bottom, as well as the smell that they give my feet every time I wear them
I spent $60 on them back in the day, so hopefully I can find something along that line, around that price that will last me a LONG time again!    I think it's time to go and do a 2nd coat on my toes!  Byebye for now!
I was just looking at the Lixasone website and I decided to  see how many posts on average I make a day (4

Each summer families, teenagers, lovers, loners, and friends head for a vacation spot somewhere
Somewhere to get away from the rushing, working, and dealing of everyday life
Some golf, some head for the mountains, some head for the beaches, some visit family, some visit friends, we all end up somewhere hopefully peacefull
The mountains are a place where you can see miles and miles away
You can see the trees bursting from the hills across the valley, you see mountain streams,waterfalls, and lakes
The air is thin, the roads are curvy
The people can be friendly or they can scare the crap out of you
Take a deep breath and feel the coolness the freshness of the air
The beach is a place of sand, breezes, waves and salty air
You see all kinds of people all around
Fat, small, young, old, the dude that is so sunburn he looks like a lobster
During the day everyone is out to get some sun, water, and fun
You ride the waves, swim around with fishes in the sea
Check the local restaurants for the best food you've tasted in a long time
Buy souvienrs for your friends
When the sun goes down people head for the streets
People walking, people driving
Everyone is having fun in their own way
Head for the beach and a midnight stroll, feel the air constantly moving, hear the ocean rush towards the land and quickly retreat to deep sea
Listen to the sounds for hours
Wait for the sun to rise and see how god created the day
urlLink The Von Bondies  @ GAMH 03-26-04     Openers:  urlLink The Cuts ,  urlLink The Vue   Celebrity sighting : Bart Davenport  Went with XX
Solideriffic line-up
Very impressed with The Vue
XX said they sound like The Stones circa 1960-something to 1970-something
I don't like the stones so who cares about dates
He probably named some albums too but instead of feigning interest, I tuned him out
The Von Bondies were great
I liked their set a lot, though Jason Stollsteimer didn't talk much--I like a little in-between song banter
Marcy Bolen (redhead guitarist) is my new fashion icon
More about her later on in the week
Their set was about an hour, and XX kept marvelling at all the fashionable types in the audience
I said, 'Honey, this ain't nothin
Wait til you go to the Arrow Bar
' And he said, 'When can we go?' and I immediately sputtered, 'Ew! NEVER!!'
In my Swedish research for yesterday's post, I came across this paragraph from P
O'Rourke (Eat the Rich):  'There are a few Swedish skinheads, who sometimes gather in numbers of about a hundred at the statue of King Carl XII in Stockholm's Kungstradgarden
They are regularly beaten up by about a thousand anti-fascist activists who then break store windows to protest the skinhead outrage
'     I bring this up not to continue beating up on the poor Swedes, but to note that cultural inclinations stay in tact thousands of miles away and a hundred years removed
Minnesota, as some of you may know, has a large Scandinavian-American population
Having suffered many years in grad school at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, I witnessed a story very similar to the one PJ recounts from his visit to Sweden
I think it was my second or third year of grad school when a white supremacist skinhead by the name of Tom David, an undergrad, decided to start a White Student Union
For at least a year and a half, the Minnesota Daily, the school's rag, featured stories related to Mr
David and the anti-Davidians
uh, sorry, that rings too close to the whole Waco thing
let's call them the anti-fascists, consistent with O'Rourke
Although the coverage of the Daily and the reaction of the anti-fascists was decidedly alarmist, if there is one thing every liberal campus needs, it's the prospect of a significant white supremacist movement in its midst
Nothing energizes the extreme left quite so much as the threat of a Nazi (at least a white one, as opposed to an Arab one)
And the presence of one that walks right into town, as opposed to hiding in a rural militia 200 miles from his nearest neighbor, is a downright boon to those right thinking individuals who think themselves quite morally distinguished by their opposition to skinheads
No doubt the Women's Studies Department and the African-American Studies Department saw significant increases to their funding, on the premise that the 'education' provided by such deparatments was necessary to combat the impending Nazi menace on campus
Which is at least somewhat odd, since white women were not a priori excluded from joining Tom David's group
In any event, there is probably two chaired professorships within these departments that should be named the Tom David Professor of blah blah blah
How bad was the White Student Union?  Tom David stood about 5'3', and probably weighed no more than 115 pounds
But what of his followers? Here, I should note that after having applied to be a registered student group (in order to get a share of student fees that go to student-based organizations), the White Student Union was rejected due to lack of significant membership
It seems that a student group must have at least three members to be so recognized, and Mr
David had only one other friend
Two white supremacists on a campus of 30,000 students, but given the hysteria, you would have thought that Coffman Union (the student center) was about to become America's Reichstag
In any event, one day on campus there were flyers put up in the stealth of night announcing the date, time (evening), and place (outside Coffman Union) for a rally of those who support the White Student Union
The obligatory counter-rally rally was then advertised widely, setting the stage for Minnesota's very own version of 100 skinheads being pummeled by a thousand anti-fascist activists
Except this is Minnesota, which has fewer Swedes than Sweden, and therefore the numbers were smaller
About 100 anti-fascists gathered outside Coffman Union spoiling for a fight
They ate their vegatarian meals to energize themselves for peaceful non-violent protest, but of course once the blood started pumping in their veins and their heart rates rose, all adherence to the pascifist ethic passed through their system as quick as their tofu salads
Waiting patiently to take on the fascist menace, they were no doubt deeply disappointed to find that there didn't seem to be anybody who supported the White Student Union
At about the time they were about to give up, some poor unsuspecting white guy, with his girlfriend, came strolling over a foot bridge that spans from the main quad of the campus, over Washington Ave
, and onto the grounds of Coffman Union
He had the misfortune of wearing black leather and a short haircut, and was immediately labeled by the mob as a skinhead
It must have pained some of the professors who taught the students in the mob to see their students judging a person by their looks, and not valuing the diversity that such people bring to the campus environment
But, in any event, the mob moved toward the token skinhead, and proceeded to beat him silly
Now here is where the Daily earned its shining moment in the sun, basking in the glory of what every journalist seeks - self-sacrifice in order to preserve the freedom of the press
It seems that there were Daily reporters there, cameras in hand, vigorously taking pictures of the melee
When the misunderstood skinhead pressed charges against his compassionate debators, the police sought evidence that would allow them to identify said assailants
Ergo, the police sought to obtain the Daily's photos, which the Daily chose not to publish, and the lonely fight of the Daily's student editor to preserve the first ammendment was on!  This was pure heaven for the Daily - they even got take on the Pigs! like their parents did in the Sixtees
If there is one thing better than covering the news, it is being the news!     Of course the argument put forward by the Daily, though I am sketchy on the details, was something like if people knew the presence of the paper at a rally might later incriminate them, they might not be inclined to engage in criminal activity
And a rally with no criminal activity doesn't sell a whole lot of papers
Of course, had the skinhead managed to get a good lick in one of his attackers, the Daily would have raced it into print, and cooperated full-scale with the police
This would only be consistent with the moral pecking order that characterizes the left: prosecuting and/or persecuting skinheads is a higher moral priority than freedom of the press, which is a higher moral priority than prosecuting anti-fascists
So you see, you can take the Swede out of the country, but you can't take the country out of the Swede
It's funny, you know how people often have smells associated with people that they know well? You know, like the aftershave your father has always worn, or the fact that your grandparents' house always smells like grandma's cooking? I had never really noticed anything like that before with any of my relatives, but tonight as I was walking through the kitchen to put away my 2-in-the-morning-dinner remnants, I caught a whiff of something, and immediately knew that it was my mother's coffee, or coffee-like thing
I've never had any, but I know that she drinks it
I used to wake up in the mornings and see her drinking it as she read the newspaper, and I would sit on the couch and pick up the comics and I could smell this drink - whatever it was
I mean, it doesn't  smell  like coffee; it has this almost sickly sweet aroma to it, that I can't identify
I'm not sure if this is just how it smells, or if it tastes as sweet too
Anyway, it's kind of neat to think that I have a smell associated with a parent
Of course, I'm sure I have more, but this was the first one that I consciously realized
Maybe I'll pick up on others now that I'm more aware of their existence

Captain America
he's kinda
swishy
Amazing how you touched my heart again today
You nearly brought me to tears
You nearly got me on my knees
You nearly floored me
I think I know where you want me to be
I've decided to stay
I've decided to commit
I've decided to do my best, and contribute in whatever way I can
I've decided to take on a more pro-active role
I've decided to make this my motto to
SEEK YE FIRST THE KINGDOM OF GOD
I'd say I dared not take on the role on the Core team as I was worried about my studies
But as I was telling my dear friend that I've decided to stay on in  Zion's Joy , I was about to say I'm worried about coping with studies, the phrase just came,  SEEK YE FIRST
I think I know where I'd be heading, at least for the next six months
I'm heading the Confirmation Music team, and I feel this is where I should be
I want to worship
I want to serve
Although I'm dead tired, I just have to make this entry
I had only three hours of sleep last night, and I went for the ZJ Retreat, although I was faced with many temptations to turn away
I went and I saw
My eyes were opened
My heart was opened
Amazingly, throughout the few hours I was there, I did not even think of my own fatigue
And I actually confessed to the whole group that I had intentions of leaving
I felt like leaving the group as I felt I was not growing in the group, and I was not contributing in any way
But I guess, after the Mission Trip, things changed
Although I said it was going to be my last camp, I've changed my mind about that too
I'd want to administer to the newly baptized people of Christ the King, in their LISS camp
I want to use HIS gift to me to help
I want to be HIS instrument
I will run to You
You were there when I was down, You were there when I rejoiced
You are here by my side
my   parents   love   me    so    much
we  have  company   over   and   im   not   allowed   to   talk   to   them
i   was   sitting   out   on   the   deck   with   them   but   my   dad   told   me   to   go   inside
&nbsp;  did you grow or did you just forget to buy new pants?-my dad mocking my purposely too short for me pants
&nbsp;  nicola doesnt care about brand names for clothes
infact nicola doesnt really care what her clothes look like anyways-mum   oooh i can tell!-lee
thanks
-me   oh darling you're welcome-lee    &nbsp;  so i went to apply to work in a seniors home
on the sheet it asked if you liked old people
i had never really had any experience with old people before so i was just like 'YEAH I  LOVE  OLD PEOPLE!'and then when i started working
i was horrified! but dont worry
i love old people now
they're so nice
but then they die
that's kindof sad sometimes
-lee    &nbsp;  what's this a picture of?-peter   a bear-me   really?looks more like your dad eh?-peter   NICOLA I HEARD THAT!-dad
okay too bad i didnt say it-me   haha i did robert!-peter   oh
hahaha good one peter!-dad    &nbsp;  once i was a boogy singer   playing in a rock and roll band   i never had no problems, yeah   running down the one-night stands   and everything around me   got to start to feeling so low   and i decided quickly,yes i did   to disco down and check out the show   and they were dancin' and singin'   and movin' to the groovin'   and just went it hit me   someone turned around and shouted   PLAY THAT FUNKY MUSIC WHITE BOY
&nbsp;  kiss  me until my   lips   are numb

So how am i?      I'm
Excited to go to california
and DISNEYLAND! cause i'm in love with my childish side
Annoyed with my family
Cause they're annoying
in that 'the world doesn't owe me anything' way
right now
is a very different feeling compared to regular happy
its better
and maybe you dont know what im talking about
but its a much more complete, rejuvinating happiness than happiness when you still feel like 'life is unfair'
you know? i dunno
but happy
in just about the best way possible
Scared
because this vacation means summer's almost over
And when summer's over
I don't get to see Emily anymore
And i don't want to not see Emily anymore and i don't want to go crazy and i don't want to
Worried/sad that i won't get an airplane note and
much more importantly
that i won't get to see Emily again before school/right after school starts
sometime around there
Which i want
So i can freak out on her and tell her im scared and hug her
and a lot
and tell her i love her and hopefully she'll say something encouraging, but even if she doesnt
just telling her everything im afraid of and how much i loved this summer and how important to me it is to stay good friends and
everything
in person
and before anything really happens yet
just to tell her that would be comforting
and to hug her
she doesnt have to say anything
and listen
and hug me
even if she never said anything the entire time i would still feel much better afterwards
i would
And i was afraid
a little while ago
that i couldn't talk about it without crying
you know what? i dont care if i cry
she can see me cry
i dont have anything to hide from her
if anything, maybe the image would stick with her and
i dunno
shed be less inclined to make decissions that would result in me being sad and missing her? i dunno
something like that
we'll see though
but im thinking maybe ill get a my good chance to hug the life out of her
and that would be nice
i'll never get any of that if i don't  get to see her the first week of school
or around that time frame
so im worried about that
i guess those two are kinda the same but theres the BIG FEAR and then tehres the fear i wont get to have a little more fun and comfort before THE BIG FEAR
if that makes any sense at all
it doesnt even make sense to me
really
amused
cause im talking to julie right now
and yelling at her
heatherless
cause shes in EUROPE
ive been missing heather this summer
i love you heather!  anxious about all that homework i havent done
damn you school! *shakes fist*  the is the first time i have ever dreaded school soooooooooooooooooooo much
freshman year i dreaded it a lot
but im thinking this time its more because junior year is crappy and freshman year
i dunno
i take that back
this year and freshman year were the worst
i dont know which was worse
they both go back to essensially the same basic fear though
which is interesting
but im crazy dreading school
i dunno
more stuff
but i need to pack for vacation so ill quickly talk about 6 flags
we went to great america yesterday
me and emily and jenna and caitlin and kara
everyone (woodlonians) else was busy/on vacation
Marthas probably mad cause she wanted us to go with her this weekend, but im gonna be gone and karas working and emily couldnt today cause of taking jenna home
craziness
poor martha, but oh well
i got my great america
so yay
jennas mom was mean though
cause she said emily could drive jenna, and then the night before she changes her mind
whats up with that? so mrs
pasch had to drive us there and my dad drove us back
less fun
but i still had a blast
we talked about sex, drugs, and violence
i poked emily in her birth defect and called her a whore for wearing a shirt that was kinda short so you could see a very small part of her stomach
shes not a whore though
she's a good kid
i met jenna
shes cool
emily and jenna have the same laugh
except jennas is deeper, louder, and more evil
but they're very similar
and the quote of the night was when me, jenna, and emily (seated in that order) were on raging bull in the front row going up the thing before the big drop and i yell over to emily 'we're still at war!' (i had declared war on her earlier) and she yells back 'I am  not  a whore!' hahaha
you kinda had to be there or at least know who emily is (as decided at lunch today, pang)
but it was hillarious
i wore my sandals
which was stupid
but oh well
cait and i had a blast while everyone else rode giant drop
aaaand
i dunno
i could write more but my mom's hassling me to pack
so i should
i'll type more from tucson/LA
urlLink    Me and a buch of guys from La Salle, Klang

Man, Études Canadiennes is really boring
We're doing  more  research for our stupid debates
Mine is really simple
The proposition, you ask?  User Garbage Fees Should Be Implemented
The answer is really simple
If Garbage Fees are put into place, then a  whole  lot of illegal dumping will take place
Yup, you guessed it, I'm posting instead of working again
That's because  I'm done all the research I need!  Crazy
Today marks the day when I enter the 21st century
I just bought a new digital camera
It's a little piece of crap (600 kilopixels) that is just used for point-shoot-download-then-upload to the web
Expect my photo here anytime soon
Playing Hookie (kind of)   My cold became a little out of control over the weekend, and I'm sure the drinking and getting 'sleepy' on Friday night around the bonfire and on the beach did not help things
T and I had a good weekend in Sconie
other than getting hit on by some chachis on Water Street and them not understanding sarcasm
'Don't you get it, clowns? We only talk to guys who have hot tubs
'  'But my buddy here has a hot tub in Pewaukee
'  My brother then chimed in: 'I think she was thinking more of, you know,  urlLink Sybaris ?'  So I woke up this morning, hacking my insides out, and called in sick
As luck would have it on a 'sick day' the sun came out in all its gloriousness
So now T (who is also taking, as she would say, a 'mental health day') and I are going to the movies
And we're going to see  urlLink this
They just started chanting 'sit down whore' on Jerry Springer
What a great day
Workin'  Insert pithy saying about raining and pouring here
I met my first student this morning
I'll be teaching him three mornings a week, then I'm meeting my second student tonight
I need to do the whole 'impress the parent' thing like crazy though
Apparently our talk on the phone left her with the impression that I'm 'childish'
Lovely
I mean, I AM childish
just not while tutoring
:p  So yeah
I'll be leaving in about an hour
this is after working for six hours today and getting up early two days in a row
I'm kind of tired
Got my schedule for the craft store today
Honestly, I was expecting to be let go because I told them I couldn't work any night shifts and I couldn't do Saturdays, but I wound up getting 30+ hours next week!  Gaahh!!  Not that I'm complaining
but I'm really surprised!  And I found $20 on the floor today
That's the second time in a month
:D  This pleases me
Exercise yesterday: 2 hours of Ultimate practice and a 20 minute walk
urlLink Fortress continents
what's a wildly pro-business, security-obsessed government to do?   Easy
Move the border
Turn the Mexican and Canadian borders into glorified checkpoints and seal off the entire continent, from Guatemala to the Arctic Circle
Bush officials don't talk much about the continental fortress, preferring terms like 'North American area of mutual confidence'
But a US-run security perimeter is precisely what is being built
I saw  Yes , or was it some contemporary offshoot, in San Francisco 20 years ago
I remember the opening act, some guy in a black body suit who juggled lights, better than I remember the music
I fell asleep during the concert
I fall asleep during most concerts
Really loud, ear drum shattering rock music has a way of lulling me to sleep
It must sound like my mothers heart beat
Not that shed ever admit it
I slept through  Peter Gabriel, Talking Heads, Blue Oyster Cult, Grateful Dead , to name a few
I was a real  wild  teenager
Sleepy, tho
Still haven't written in the notebook guys
I'll get it to ya ASAP
Wow I just realized the time on this 3 hours off
It's 8:28 not 5:28
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The auther, Judy Brady, in I WANT A WIFE, starts out&nbsp; with a male friend, recently divorced, who has one child with his ex-wife and now looking for another wife
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She goes on talking of how she thought of him when ironing one night and how she'd like a wife for herself, meaning for someone to take care of her and run errands, keeep track of dental and doctor appointments, mend clothes, feed kids, arrange school events, take them to the park and so on
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While reading this essay, I found her repetition in wanting a wife mentioned over and over again
&nbsp; Things such as, 'I want a wife to take care&nbsp;of my children,' or 'I want a wife who takes care of the children when they are sick,' or 'I want a wife who will take care&nbsp;of the babysitting arrangements or wanting a wife who is faithful, honest, entertains, and is a good cook
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This essay sounds like the woman is the jack of all trades and does more than a man has to
&nbsp; In the world today,&nbsp; this essay leaves the reader with false accusations
&nbsp; In the way wives nurture others, I find this si habit in being brought up
&nbsp; Today, roles have changes with the mother working and the father watching and raising kids
&nbsp; Today, it is whatever works out
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people are single parents, such as myself, doing the 'Mr
'&nbsp; Every household is different so this essay I find distracting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It sounds like she is unhappy in her role of motherhood
&nbsp; I think, by nature, mothers are nurturers at heart
&nbsp; Most of us are
&nbsp; I believe some of it comes natural
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a single parent, it is oberbearing at times but I love my kids
&nbsp; They have responsibility with helping when I haven't a spouse to rely on
&nbsp; Sometimes that would be nice
&nbsp; I've adjusted to the single parent role
&nbsp; I may not always like it but I do what I can
Wow, relaxation!  Middle of the Easter holidays (shhh, got lots of work to do but
) ANYWAYS!!  Been havin fun!  I PROMISE to update as often as I can now because I'm wasting my hosting
Been recording loads of cool stuff with Chris n James n Kayla etc
I think I'll start some revising this week, after all, we got these 'big' (so they say) tests which start on the Wednesday back
I'm thinking of changing the template for this blog too, and I'll get the gallery back online shortly!  Gotta go now, I'm starting to get tired
This is the Easter Holidays!  Bed time does not exist!  I'm going anyway mwahaha
When I'm not writing I think of lots of things to say
I've written whole stories in my head, but now I'm blank
This is my day off
When I agreed to finish the year for another teacher, I didn't really want to teach full time
There are a lot of reasons, one of which is I'm basically lazy
But the legitimate reasons have to do with my family and my health
I have a 3 year old who I really like keeping at home
He's such a home body that he doesn't like to go anywhere
I never had that option, except in the summer, with the other children, so I fight for time home whenever I can
Another reason is my health
I have some kind of autoimmune disease
I've been to 4 different specialists and they can't seem to agree on anything
I have constant back pain, sciatica, restless legs, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, acid reflux, and an asortment of aches and pains that come and go as they please
I've taken a ton of meds
Pain killers don't do much, maybe it's because the pain is so bad it would take too much to help it
I don't like to be a whiner
I really try to be as positive and upbeat as I can, but sometimes I just want to cry
That explains the antidepressants I also have to take
has been helpful, but she is just as baffled as I am
Sometimes I really do think it's all in my head, but she assures me that it isn't
That's kind of a twist, usually you hear about drs
who think you are making everything up, but mine believes me, she just doesn't know how to help me
We keep things like blood pressure and cholesterol under control with meds, but I still wonder if there is something we just haven't figured out yet
A few weeks ago I had a terrible kidney infection
We treated it with strong anitbiotics, but as the infection got better, I felt worse
It turns out I have a kidney stone
It's lodged in the kidney, but could move out at any time
I will have it checked again in a couple of months
If it gets any bigger, I could have a hard time passing it
AS of today, I feel pretty good, but my back is nagging, my ankles hurt if I stand too long, and I have cramps
That is actually a normal day for me
I don't remember what it is like to not be in constant pain
So, you can see why I like having a day off once in a while
I do enjoy teaching, though
I am looking forward to next fall
I'm hoping to have my own class again and I'm looking ahead to lessons plans, etc
I want middle school, but may end up staying in second grade
Either way I am excited
Project Urban Chaos is now: Project Urban Chaos: Resurrected   Changes:  Wrath will be more Secretive and more darker based, and Mercy will be based more on the Cherubim and the Seraphim
Tonight I'm off to Meaghans, my best friend, to hang and drink and watch movies
I'm excited! Scot, Jared, and Rob are coming too! Will this be the night that my fortune was talking about?? hehe
Wish me luck!  ~Virginia
hindi ako mayabang na nilalang
WAHAHAHAHA! AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAA!!!!!! hoohoo
hoo boy
wahaha
ayos yun
pwede na pala akong mag-komedyante niyan eh!  ayan, seryoso na
hindi ako mayabang na nilalang
totoo yan, kahit minsan (uhm, sige na nga, madalas) parang hindi
hindi nga, humble type ako
ayoko nang nagyayabang ako at ayoko ng mga taong mayayabang
ayoko talaga
ngunit, sa pagkakataong ito, kailangang malaman ng aking mga faithful readers ang katotohanan
ayokong lapastanganin ang kapwa kong mga iskulmeyts
proud ako sa kanila
mahuhusay sila
magagaling
ayokong maliitin ang mga nakamit nilang pagkapanalo sa dinami-daming pagsasanay na ginawa nila
namula ang kanilang mga kamay sa kakaswing, mga paa sa kasisipa, mga utak sa kakaisip
pero ito talaga ang totoo-- ako lamang ang nagbingay ng dangal sa batch namin sa DPS
oo, ako lamang
tanging ako lamang
hindi si japoy, hindi si matet, hindi si ian kit at hindi rin si sheila
ako lang
hahahahaha
may kokontra ba? bakit, ano naman ang mali sa sinabi ko? malamang si japoy 'di na pwede kasi wala na siya
si ian kit naman runner-up lang
ha! runner-up! talo sa chiang kai shek! si sheila naman nanalo pero wala na namang may pakialam dun eh, at saka hindi naman namin yun ka-batchmate
si matet naman, saan ba naglaro yun? sa california? sus, no match sakin yan boy
pero, kahit totoo ang pangalawa kong talata, tanging ako lamang ang naniniwala dito
lahat ng mga naiwan sa DPS ay nakalimutan na kung sino ako, pero kahit noon pa ay wala naman talagang may pakialam doon
alam niyo ba kung bakit? heto ang aking analysis: -si japoy ay nananalo sa international level
isa siyang boy tae kwon do, kaya ang hinahatid niyang mensahe sa mga taga ibang school ay, 'kapag kinupal niyo ang DPS, pagsisisipain ko kayo hanggang mamula na ang buong katawan ninyo!' lumalabas siya sa tv
ang average dilimanian ay walang pakialam na hindi siya marunong mag-sipilyo, basta madalas makita sa tv sikat
at gwapo siya, na makikita sa official phrase ng mga bona fide DPS girls: 'i love you japoy! i crush you! you're so gwapo talaga!' may kasabihan na sa akin lang nanggaling pero totoo rin naman: kung babae ka at wala kang crush kay japoy, either hindi ka dilimanian or tibo ka
-si ian kit at si sheila ay lumabas sa tv
'nuff said
-si matet ay isang golfista na lumaban sa california ata
heniweiz, lamang siya sa akin (actually, sila ni japoy) dahil hindi nila tinalo si berto, si juan at si nonoy; ang tinalo nila ay si joe, si tom at si harry
ano ba naman yan, ang sama ko talagang nilalang; nakikipag-sagupaan ako sa mga sarili kong kababayan para lang mapatunayang marunong akong mag-sulat
buti pa sila, at least kahit paano nabigyang dangal nila ang buong pinas, na para bang sabihin, 'mess with the PI and you die apple pie!' ok, ansagwa nun
kalimutan
heto naman ang sa akin
unang-una, kailan man ay hindi pa ako lumabas sa tv bilang contestant (naging spectator ako noong laban ni ian kit sa LG)
tapos, mali ang mensaheng ipinapadala ko sa mga kabataan ng DPS
ang mga nasabi kong celebs kuno ay sinasabi kumbaga 'practice hard, study hard, reach for your dreams!' at ako naman ay nagsasabi ng 'have angst and lots of it
pain is good
you either have talent or you don't
if you don't, malas lang, wala kang mapapala sa buhay,' datapwa't hindi ako nag-aral kailanman para sa mga paligsahang sinalihan ko
ngunit, ang mismong dahilan kung bakit mas kanais-nais ang dangal na idinadala ng ibang dilimanians sa DPS ay dahil sa aming nalalabing tadhana
isipin niyo na lang na ang mga nasabi ko'y mga athletes o mga lumabas sa tv
ang mga athletes ay magpapalakas sa mga international squads natin, at makikilala ang pilipinas bilang isang bansa na punung-puno ng mga mahuhusay at talentadong nilalang sa larangan ng sports
ang mga lumabas na sa tv, bagama't sanay na sila sa kamera, ay malamang na magiging mga talk show host o broadcaster, yun bang matalino ka pero sikat ka
ako naman, ano kaya ang kapalaran ko? isipin muna natin a
writing
writing
naku, masamang kombinasyon yan! alam niyo na ba kung bakit?  sige, sasabihin ko na
balang araw, gagawa ako ng mga theorem
oo, tama ka, theorem nga, yung mga pinapakabisado sa inyo sa geom na nagpapasakit lamang ng ulo ninyo, yung mga walang kwentang 'if a and b are elements of the set of integers and n is the power to which a and b are raised to the nth degree, then the subset of the correlation between the line formed between a and b are directly proportionate to the perpendicular velocity represented by (a-n) over (b-m) such that for all x there exists at most one value for y iff the value of r on the equation of the circle exceeds the limits of the polynomial p(x), in which case the quadratic formula is used to determine the principal nth root of the equation
' tama na! hindi ko mapipigilan ang sarili kong tadhana
kung ayaw ninyong pahirapan ang mga anak ninyo pagdating nila sa hayskul, patayin niyo na ako habang maaga pa
kahit hindi naman sigurado na ganyan nga ang magiging silbi ko sa mundong ito, it's better safe than sorry
the author would like to note that he really isn't an arrogant bastard; he merely used this persona for comic effect in the entry (though it seems he was the only one who found anything to laugh at)
he is actually a pretty nice guy, very down to earth and fun to be with, and most certainly a perfect gentleman
oh, and some say he's kinda cute too
completely wrong thought of the day: girl at window: hello sir, may i take your order? me: yeah, i think i'll have one of those sandwiches
yung nasa promo
girl at window: ok, anything else sir? me: hinde, ok na yan
girl at window: 69 po sir
me: hinde hinde, ok na nga eh, yung sandwich na lang
girl at window: *looks pissed* 69 pesos po
me: oh
I'll start off with a quote:   I dig music -Russell Hammond, Almost Famous  That pretty much sums up how I feel about it
With a lack of a better quote off the top of my head
There is nothing I dislike about it, and with the passionate love that I have for it, I feel like I have every right to critique it with total emmotion
My main love is Rock and Roll
So if I ever knock any rap, country, pop/mainstream
it's just me either a
not knowing too much about the certain artist or b
me being an idiot
I do like certain forms of rap, country, and pop, but I just don't have the same passion for it as most
Example: Rap
Love N
, Public Enemy, Beastie Boys, Dizzee Rascal, Emienem, Biggie, Tupac
Hate DMX, Ja-Rule, etc
Example: Country
Love Johnny Cash & Wille Nelson
Hate Garth Brooks & Travis Tritt
So, with certain future concert reviews of mine, please bear all this in mind
Granted, I usually only go to rock, funk, pop, bluegrass, and folk type shows, I feel like somewhat of a disclaimer was in order, so please, bear this in mind
Some people just dont seem to get it!&nbsp; I am so fuckn mad
&nbsp;I hate when a&nbsp;guy treats me like if I were a little kid, or worse than that his daughter!! What the fucking fuck man! Im too old to put up with that kind of shit
&nbsp; Dont be threatening me that if I dont *behave* a certain way Im not gonna get to do certain things
&nbsp; So damn lame! And then to top it off I cant open my mouth cause the second that I do, I am either supposedly cutting them off, or bitching, or what not
&nbsp; GEEZUS&nbsp;GIVE ME A FUCKING BREAK!&nbsp; Maybe if I had a dick between my legs, was 27 y
o and umemployed, I would get more attention
&nbsp; Some people just dont know a good thing when they have it
&nbsp; FUCK THAT!&nbsp; The pathetic and sad part is that I get all upset, while the other sneaky person is having a ball
&nbsp; Im a fucking great girl, I do my shit and when it all boils down to it, I do it alone, I dont need crap from anyone
and I ESPECIALLY dont need to put up with it
How some people can be so nice one minute and total jerks the next is beyond me!
Today went to school as usual, nothing much happen
Then came home, did some work and sleep
Its always fixed la
After that did abit of my homework again, then bing rong msg me to watch discovery channel
There's this documentary on Bruce Lee, to me, the greatest martial artist that had ever lived
It talked about his works, philosophy on martial arts
It is kinda sad still thinking about it, he has no more sons to carry on his generation after brandon died
He also has a lot of interesting quotes
no mood for blogging today, must go study le
tomolo test
well my presentation for tomorrow is done, thats good
i never knew what stress was till i came to college
not only is school demanding, but so are people
of course the more u put in the more u get out
i can honestly say that everyday i get a little closer to being the person i wanna be
i see now that that is why certain people have left my life
those who are afraid to change themselves don't want to see other people change, those that are constantly changing don't mind seeing other's change
they understand that while certain bits of ur personality or certain habits may change, u are still the same person, just a little bit better now
:)  don't get me wrong, this entry isn't about dissing anyone, it's just an idea i have right now
i also wanna say thanx to my friends
u all kick ass!!!  oh yeah baby, u know who u are
good luck to everyone during this new week, may it be just a little better than last week (though my last week went so well
)hehehe

Tech Support Saga Update   What I thought was a vast conspiracy on the part of D*ll to avoid replacing our bad hard drive was in fact a network error
The company who does their on-site tech support has a network problem earlier this week
Somehow they managed to get a guy out to the house yesterday (Tues) to install the new HD
So far so good
An open letter
It hit me with the force equivilent to a drop kick in the face
You're a total asshole
You've been one all along
How could I not see that? Maybe I had some rare form of brain cancer
I don't know
You grate on my nerves
Every little thing I overlooked for the sake of it just irritates the sweet ba-jesus out of me
From one manipulative bitch to another  See you in hell
July, 30th, 2004 Today was such a great day
It started 11
St Jude hosted first Talent show ever
:) Regina, Claire, and brook sang a song and danced
I forgot what   is the name of it but it went someting like this - thumbs up, elbows back, feet apart, knees together , bottoms up etc
They learned it during the summer camp and they all did great
Their  little performance was a hit
Everybody loved it
Regina was wearing her Belle dress and shoes and was cute as ever
She got so many comments  how pretty and beautiful and cute she looks
I'm so proud of her
At first she told me she does not want to do it, but finally when we went to back to hospital she said she was ready to sing and dance is front of the audience
AND she did not get stage fright! You go girl!!1 :)  After that she had her Radiation treatment- she  did really well
Did not move at all
Then we went to Costco , bought some water
Then I found Kohls- my favoite store in the Whole wide world
I needed a suitcase and since kohls  always has sails I got one bright red suitcase  on sale 60% off- I payed 78 dollars
It is huge red suitcase :)  After that we went to see The Cinderella story- she loved it
It was to ' CHEEZZZZZY  ' for me
Boy  meets a girl, girl meets a boy, blah, blah , blah
Classic Disney
But oh well, all the things we do to make our kids happy
And I want to make her happy, but the same time I'm really , really tired doing everything she wants
I want to do something I WANT!   She even gets frustraited when I talk to somebody Little WAY to long- 10 minutes
She let's me know by interrupting me and telling me that MOM, YOU NEED TO TALK TO ME!! WTF??????  I've been told by 4 year old what to do, what to wear and with whoom to talk to
Only thing she does not tell me is WHAT  should I eat
But she did mention that I got bigger
Yeah, you heard it right
SHe  monitors my weight
Righ now she is in bed and watching video
I just changed her dressing(central IV line dressing, if you wonder)
She wanted to play here instead, but I told her that It is my time now
Chill out babe!!!
The new blog i made
all about the music -- I'm gonna start reveiwing new shit, post when I can
News, by definition, usually is bad news
Thousands of passenger jets ply the world's skies every day and touch down safely
You don't read about that in the newspaper
But when one doesn't, that's front-page news
Yet journalism, to be valid, has to be more than just a daily reaction to splattered blood
Gene Roberts, the great managing editor of the Philadelphia Inquirer, used to say, “Great stories don’t break, they ooze
”  The airliner crash is news because it breaks the normal course of things
In Iraq after the fall of Saddam, there is no normal course of things
But the inertia of journalism grinds on
Explosions and violence rule the coverage, in part because, by reflex, that's what journalists know how to do, know what to see
The violent stories punch their way to the top of every newscast
Flames, screams, mayhem, sometimes on a gruesome scale
Yet it is equally true that every day in Iraq, many places enjoy peace and prosperity, have clean water and electricity and modern schools that they never had before
Souks bustle and wheat grows and children play
But that is not news
Or is it?  Because now 'bad news' is itself the news story
People want to know if the Iraq experiment is working
Every day they open a newspaper or flick on the news, they see the graphic evidence that tells them it is not
Tonight, my boss gave me a page to fill
He told me to put the 'Iraq military wrap' on it
I knew exactly what he meant: The AP's Iraq story is all about skirmishes and car-bombs
It runs every day
So does at least one sidebar (US-Iraq or UN-Iraq) on the political squabbling
Where's the 'reconstruction wrap?' Where's the story on the rebuilding: how well it's going, or isn't; what is getting done, what is not getting done?  Roberts' dictum wasn't about good news or bad news
It was about great stories, real stories, history in the present tense
urlLink  This editorial column,   by Rod Dreher, a writer for The Dallas Morning News, is behind a password wall, but it's excellent
It's titled  Q: What's wrong with this picture? A: It's the only one like it we could find
It's accompanied by an AP photo which bears the caption 'Marine Sgt
William Perry of Texarkana, Texas, passed out school supplies at the Anwal Elementary School in Kandari, Iraq, on May 11
'    Dreher opens by asking, 'Are the news media giving Americans an accurate picture of what's really going on in Iraq?'    Not according to the American people, who say they've seen too many photos of Abu Ghraib prison abuses
A CBS News poll released on May 24 revealed that 61 percent of those polled believe the news media are spending too much time on the Abu Ghraib story
This jibes with what some of us on the editorial board have been hearing more and more: that average Americans believe the news media are obsessed with bad news from Iraq and aren't paying enough attention to the good things going on there
We decided to search photo wire service archives for the past month, looking for images of U
soldiers engaged in helping Iraqis instead of shooting at them
We were startled to discover that the photo accompanying this text was the only image of its kind that moved on the wires in recent weeks
This newspaper's photo department told me that if news photographers aren't shooting those pictures, it's because media back home aren't interested in those stories
He goes on to make the right point: 'It is understandable that breaking news eats up the limited journalistic resources on the ground, but this means that Americans are not getting the complete story from their media
'  He then gives a list of the good news that 'oozes' out of Iraq
Some of it -- much of it -- I've posted up here in other places: the more than 2,500 schools have been rebuilt or renovated, with 1,500 more scheduled to be completed by year's end (UNICEF report), the propaganda-free textbooks (no more 'Baba Saddam, we love you!')
Health-care spending 26 times what it was under Saddam, restoration of the marshlands, the national polls that show, according to the pollsters, 'a strikingly optimistic people, expressing growing interest in politics, broad rejection of political violence, rising trust in the Iraqi police and army and preference for an inclusive and democratic government
'  He rightly reminds his readers of the big picture, in a sentence which arguably could be a nut-graph in any story out of Iraq: 'Whatever mistakes American occupiers have made in Iraq –- and there have been many of them -– the fact remains that the mass murderer who ran Iraq into the ground was overthrown and is now in jail awaiting trial
'  An interesting aspect of his article is that he directs his readers to 'check out one of the increasingly popular Internet web logs from English-speaking Iraqis living in the country and sharing their reporting and perspectives
' He mentions some of the ones I have linked over on the righthand side of this page
I'm not saying Dreher is copping out
I think he's pretty courageous to address this issue directly
But what does it say when someone representing a major media outlet in this country concedes that the rest of the Iraq story is missing, is going to remain missing, and refers his readers to average Iraqi citizens' Web logs? To me, that's a dereliction of the responsibility that we ought to feel in the First Amendment
He also cites  urlLink  Jay Rosen's  PressThink
org    Web log
Rosen, head of New York University's journalism department, recently wrote his own  urlLink  analysis of the missing coverage from Iraq
He takes a slightly different approach
He couches his critique not so much as good news weighed against bad news, but as noticing that a key piece of the information puzzle is missing
What I'm missing from the news coverage I consume is not 'positive' stories or the cheery news out of Iraq-- it's the re-building story in its totality, good, bad and middling
We need to sever that narrative
what are we doing to re-build Iraq, what are the Iraqi's doing, how is it going, how can we tell?    His conclusion?   The news from Iraq is not too negative; it's too narrow
Bit by bit, and for reasons probably sound at the time, the press allowed its coverage from Iraq to develop as a military story, in which the 'security situation' is the base line reality, and threats of violence -- or if not violence, tensions that could fracture the society -- overshadow other things going on
Second place in that narrative goes to the jockeying for political control and influence in the 'new' Iraq, especially among the known factions
Both are essential
Both are truth
But smart journalists could have recognized before the war began that these two stories, responsibly reported, would not be enough to inform Americans about what's going on in the country their own country invaded, promising to re-build it after the fall of Saddam
(A moral promise implicating all of us
) The re-building of Iraq is complicated, sprawling, thick with life -- and a difficult thing to inform us about, especially given the language barrier
It is far less dramatic than a bombing, way more elusive than a briefing
The entire population of Iraq is a player in the re-building story, not just the political class or clergy
And to get the story requires close attention to changes in daily life -- normal life -- all around the country, including the repair of public infrastructure and the recovery of institutions that make normalcy possible
Then there's the story of bottom-up democracy, the building of which was promised to Iraq, and to the soliders who fought to free Iraq
Rosen, too, is frustrated because, after tuning in to Iraq for a year, 'I learned something about the prosecution of the ongoing war, and a lot about the scandal in the military because of Abu Ghraib
I know a great deal about the politics of the war back in Washington, and among the Bush team
But I have almost no clear picture of daily life and the struggle for normalcy in Iraq after it fell to ruin under Saddam and during the war
Depite spot coverage here and there, including Iraqi-in-the-street stories, I don't know from my own press where the re-building effort actually stands
'  And he, too, reports that the source he turns to for this information is the Internet
Specifically, 'Iraqi blogs
'  The leader of one of the half-dozen top journalism schools in the United States of America gets his real news about Iraq from Zeyad, Alaa, Muhammad, Omar, a dentist, a housewife, people who write for free in their Web cafes in Basra and Baghdad
What about the rest of us?  Rosen looks to the upcoming election and quotes Peter Levine: 'A citizen's main responsibility is to decide whether the Bush Administration has done a good job so far, and to vote accordingly this November
'   The truth about Iraq after Saddam needed three legs to stand on, and it only got two: the military and security story, the jockeying for power and influence
There ought to have been, from the start, at least a partial preoccupation with re-building Iraq, the recovery of daily life, including the development of measures to chart progress, a task well within the reach of the American press
On the whole that narrative went missing
It was not inevitable this would happen, but if it did happen, the omission might yet be corrected, or at the very least reflected on when the ombudsmen of the nation sit down and read their mail, or pen their Sunday columns
Did American journalists give the re-building and democracy-building story their best shot? And if they didn't, is there yet time to make a new judgment, put forward a better argument, and set things right in the news from Iraq?

02 June 2004  Dear Mr Currie  Thank you for taking the time to contact Starbucks Coffee Company
It is always a sincere pleasure to hear from our valued, caffeine addicted, customers! Sadly, we have no immediate plans for the Channel Islands, though it remains under consideration
I have shared your comments with the Store Development Team who welcome customer input in their considerations
I hope you will continue to enjoy our coffee for many years to come

'Doctor, doctor help me please
I know you'll understand
There's a time device inside of me, I'm a self destructing man
'   I've been phoning my friend, his phone doesn't work
I call the cell and he says 'I'll call you back'
Which means forget it, I'm not calling you back in LA language
Needless to say, I get paranoid
Like there's some plot to keep me from talking to my best friend
Or maybe he doesn't want to talk to me because he's got this 'life' and and I don't and there's no time for the looser
My mind goes places
But I don't take my friends there, just my mind
I know it's irrational
I don't entertain these thoughts for more than the instant they are there
But they occur
I reccognize them, say goodbye and go on my merry way
I only get paranoid about not being able to reach my best friend
I guess it's a sign of insecurity where that is concerned
He's a male and the first and the only positive male relationship I have ever had in my life
So it's important to me
Probably more important than anyone will ever realize
Probably too important
My emotions have been all over the place with our friendship and I am so glad that I have nailed down it's importance, before I sabotaged the whole thing
I love the guy, he's my teacher, my confidant, my brother, my friend
i just wish we could spend more time together
But such is life
Take what you can get, when you can get it
Friends are hard to find for me
I have maybe a few associates but only two real friends
And that's by choice
Not everyone is your friend
One has to remember that, especially when it comes to secrets and good deeds and trust
Sour and I had a hair dying party this afternoon
I decided spring called for a lighter shade of brown with a redish hue
She decided on a blonder shade
This is the lightest I have ever dyed my hair :)  I like it!  Otherwise, I did two presentations on Relay at the local highschool
caused one little girl to run from the room crying
Cancer is a touchy subject
Well, I'm going to nap on the couch :) Hope you had a good Monday!

Thank you Mary for providing some good opinion to respond to
As I was reading your post I found my self disagreeing with a couple of statements you made so I had to respond
I just don't see how you can say 'I want to take down the idea that right-winged, conservatives aren't open people
DOn't believe that stereotype,' when you yourself blatantly state: ' Students who are viewed to be the smart ones are viewed that way
because they're left-winged/secularists who use data up the ying-yang to prove their point
' Isn't that a major stereotype you just have created yourself? It seems as if you call all the 'smart' people boot-lickers who side with the side that their liberal teachers take, that we are not guided by morals in our arguments but only by 'data' and scientific experiments
I personally have very strong morals I comply with and I am somewhat religious (if there is such a thing) but I always prove my every argument with 'imperical data' just because that's the info that can not be made up and can not be proven wrong or considered opinionated; numbers do not swing either liberal or conservative, they are neutral
What you say about writing papers that teachers like I also consider to be very argumentative, and it of course depends on the school you go to, but the majority of teachers I am sure would prefer you to write a paper that is original in idea and content and shows you to be open-minded thinker
About abortion, it's great that you have that kind of sense of responsibility for your actions, and I think it's partly because you know that that won't ever happen to you, but we have to remember about all the people that simply do not have that kind of education/surrounding atmosphere/family to support them when they are faced with that kind of choice of either having a child and giving up their future or seeing a doctor for a couple hours and killing that precious spark of life
I still don't know what I would exactly do myself, but I would probably side with you
However I am very strongly for abortion for those who NEED it, or who believe they do
GM: I don't know how you can tell a gay person that he/she wasn't even 'intended' to be alive on this earth, just because it says in the Bible that God did not include gays in his original design
I read the Bible many times and I totally agree with Rob that if we do not follow everything there is written in it, like fasting and strictly following the ten commandments, then why should we tell other people that they don't have the right to marry just because it says so in the Bible
I really think there shouldn't even be such an issue
I want to reference slavery in what Jefferson wrote about the exclusion of Black people from the constitutional definition of 'men' just based on the reasoning that Afr
are 'a different species,' thus degrading 'a whole race of men from the rank in the scale of being which THEIR(?) Creator may perhaps have given them
' Maybe gays should be excluded from the ranks of 'men'?, they are sort of a different species too
'We are at war
with terrorism
racism
but most of all we are at war with ourselves
Here's a word I use too much: cacophony
Which is defined as either
Jarring, discordant sound; dissonance or  The use of harsh or discordant sounds in literary composition, as for poetic effect
As in: A  cacophony  of horns rang during the traffic jam
or          The harsh  cacophony  of voices gave texture to the piece
See?  I give to the community

Had a bonkers dream last night: I was taking Angel Dust with a bloke from my university course and we were kinda skating (without skates) all over a strange urban environment
It was like cyberspace, we went into buildings which were almost infinitely large and represented space that businesses could set up in
It all had something to do with GameCube, because it was sadly empty, although a couple of companies had strange interfaces installed there
Before long I was searching for something
Then I was with my family at a railway station
I was a werewolf on the verge of change and I knew I was about to eat someone (seen Val Helsing and Ginger Snaps recently!) and my mum was urging me to escape, which I think I did
But maybe I bit a few people on the way
I kinda wanted to go ape-shit!  Then my car cropped up, and I made breakfast out of sherbert which stuck together into a wierd sheet of goop
Then I woke up
How boring for you to read!  ---  The drive to work was stupid
Stuck behind a garbage truck
What the fudge was it doing on the road at 8
55am? They're supposed to piss you off by waking you up, not making you late

So all in all a very good time is being had
The Rock N ROll Hall of Fame was a bust even the old guy (coach Steve my age) said it wasnt worth the time or admission price of $20
I just saw 'House of Sand and Fog'
What a great movie!  Battles for real estate have never been more dramatic
Jennifer Connelly plays a woman who was wrongly evicted from her house, as the county claimed she failed to pay a tax that she didn't even need to pay
But Connelly could have prevented it from happening had she bothered to open her mail!  Meanwhile, Ben Kingsley, a former Iranian colonel buys the house at auction and refuses to leave despite learning of Connelly's predicament
I loved the depiction of Kingsley, his wife and his son
Despite his financial stubbornness, it's clear that Kingsley only wants whats best for his family
That makes the devastating events in the last half-hour of the film especially heartbreaking
Go see this movie now!
Life     Life can be as bright as the moon in the night or as rough as a storm at sea
Life can be joyful life can be sad it has it's ups and downs and there are good times and bad
Chose the right path there are good things in store and you will find some one you can love and adore
All good things come to an end but at least you know you left this world with a friend

By: Sean Passwaters  ________________________________________________                            My Love for Her     I flood her with love like a giant tidal wave and I try to confess but I am not that brave
She says were just friends but we can be much more but she leaves me behind a closed and locked door
I try to get through but to no avail and I am afraid she will crush my heart for it is so frail
Her beauty is stunning and she is smart and cunning I wish I could say how I truly feel and the dream I have of her were really real
By: Sean Passwaters                            The Dark          As I walk through the dark alone and affright looking for one glimpse of the precious light
As it glimmers and gleams at the end of the tunnel the fresh air hits me so quick and suddel
It is clear to me now that I'm here for a reason now that I escaped the under ground prison
I will live my life with love and joy now that I turned to man from boy

Update on  George Eads  and  Jorja Fox :    BACK ON THE JOB: Exclusive sources telling  urlLink E! News Live  that  Jorja Fox  will report back to work at CSI and it was just a misunderstanding with CBS
'They think it's about money and it's not,'  Eads   urlLink said
'I overslept
I woke up white as a sheet 3 1/2 hours after I was supposed to be on the set
'   He called in, said he was on his way and was told, 'Don't bother,' Eads said
The Texas native compared himself to a football star who makes a similar error
'It's like I'm the quarterback with the Dallas Cowboys and I overslept the first day of practice,' he said
'I'd expect the coach to have me run hills and run wind sprints until the sun goes down, not you know, completely fire me
'   Asked if CBS had sought an apology from him, he replied: 'Let me tell you, I've apologized nine ways to Sunday
It's a big misunderstanding, straight up
'   'I want all this to work out
'CSI' is a part of who I am,' Eads said
Eads said he wants to speak with Moonves to resolve the issue but had yet to reach him
He compared getting hold of Moonves, a top executive with CBS parent company Viacom, to reaching the mysterious Charlie in 'Charlie's Angels
'   'If after I've spoken to him from my heart he knows exactly what the situation is, he's the boss
It's still up to him
'    Calling himself the quarterback may be a bit much, but it's interesting that  Eads  has said from the beginning that it was a mistake and all the stories have said that he was late but not that he failed to show
We've heard absolutely nothing from  Jorja Fox , but she's coming back
I'm not surprised that she's coming back, but I do find the contrast in treatment extremely irritating
Especially since I like Nick's character and Sara has gotten on my nerves from the beginning
urlLink    Its my Birthday tomorrow ! The collage of Garfield strips brings out my feelings on the eve of my Birthday !

urlLink Diet Coke with Lime

Why on Earth is everything set up backwards? All the foods that are good for you taste horrible
All the really good-tasting foods are horrible for your health
Doing good for the world takes a helluva lot of work
Being good to people runs the risk of being taken advantage of
Wouldn't it make more sense to have things be  easy  to do when they're also the best thing to do? What gives?  There is no God
no, he  DIDN'T  know about tyler, and that's why it went so far
but you  DO , so why would you even consider starting something like that
Stop calling me stupid and start worrying about yourself
Hmm just one shot aje
Nikah pic took on the night
will post some more later
I just hate that I am such a coward at many times
If someone holds a knife at my throat, I'd doubt that I would fight back no matter how much I say to myself I would
I would most probably be just caught up with the moment
There are just somethings you can only gain from experience and I have had a fair share of them
I am literally spoiled
I have a iPAQ (~$560), a powershot S50 (~$480), and a cell that I put no value on
These three things I always carry around
Sometimes, I just wish I could trade places and experience what it feels like to be not as privileged
That experience sound knock some sense into me
I don't want everything to be given to me on a silver platter
I want to just be out there in the real world
I want to be a survivor such as like you can throw me in any place or situation and I'll live through it
---------------------  Some other thoughts
As I mentioned before, I am a coward
I get things half done and then do not have the guts to finish what I set myself out to do
In fact, the person who this pertains to especially doesn't even know of my blog
All the better, I just have a false sense of security
I just dream every night and wish I could just pick up that phone and ask
I just worry about stupid consequences and bad lingering memories of the past just always hold me in chains
Happiness just lies around the corner but I am too afraid to go for it
I walk until the final block and wait for a miracle or just wonder when will I be ready to cross that final block
To begin today, a little update
Oral-skank still hasn't gotten back to me, but I did get a response from someone else
Now tell me what you think
$625 (excellent), all utils including DSL and cable (right on), parking etc
Sounds too good, well it may be
He's 32 and his screen name involves the numbers 69
I'm a little concerned about this
Maybe he's just juvenile enough to think that that number is funny or something, but didn't we grow out of that in like 6th grade?  Well I mailed him back and asked some questions
Move-in would be mid-Feb
And on the map it looks really easy to get to from the east
Okay on to a new subject
My sister brought this up last night
On Jeopardy they just say 'in the form of a question,' and they don't really expound on that, so she was like 'If I got on Jeopardy instead of saying 'What is Jupiter?' I'd say 'Is it Jupiter?''  This went back an forth until we got a little out of hand, here's some possibilities for Jeopardy answers:    Old Way: What is
an American Bulldog? Where is
Milan? Who is
Elizabeth Taylor? What is 'On Top of Old Smokey?' What is
Pizza?    New Way: Did I just run over
an American Bulldog? Do they have whorehouses in
Milan? Does anybody really care about
Elizabeth Taylor? Have you ever had sex
'On Top of Old Smokey?' Do you throw up from eating too much
Pizza?    See the improvement? I do
Stimu-lator
Don't you fret for your buddy Sambo, folks, he knows what he's doing
(regading last post's problem) Yeah!   So I have an ear infection
No big deal, though
I just have to remember to take a pill 3 times a day
Not that I'm not used to taking that pill
heh, I think this is the 4th time I've needed it! First time was for Bronkitis, second time, a different ear infection
thrid time, i had a sort of Bronkitis again
and then fourth time
another ear infection
I'm beginning to sence a nasty pattern
Aww well, it's never really bad
It's kinda fun, actually, for some odd reason I get a wee thrill out of seeing my name on a pill bottle, of a bottle that I can fully claim! It is MINE! 100%! MIIIINNE! Only I can have it! and I will have it
ALL OF IT! BWAHAHAAH!
yay for Amoixilin! yeah, I'm a weird one, Mr
Grinch
Aww well
Ear infection = no big deal
My ear will probably'll be back to normal in a couple o' days
In other news
Anthony and Erin are back together, FINALLY! (it's been a
) When they are apart, the world is anarky
Things are the way they are meant to be with anthony and erin together
heh, as you can tell, I'm in kind of a good mood
I'm proud of myself because I actually did Statistics homework tonight
Believe it or not, I was actually having a really nasty night before I got a phone call
I was moping, I was in a slump, I was tired of all dis UHS crap! I think it started when I found out I failed the Frankenstein test
I got bummed out
and yelled at my cousin online
I apoligzed quickly afterword, but yeah
I had a rough night
I got a little inspired, and started doing homework
did a little bit of homework, then
ring ring!  Oh, it's 9:10! That's gotta be Rachel calling
(she calls every night just after 9, when she gets unlimited minites on her cell phone
long distance, you know
) I'm always positive it's her, so I usually answer the phone with 'Hey!' but tonight, since I was a little bit exaspurated, I answered with 'Arrrr!!!!!!!!!' I heard her chuckle
Then my dad answered
'Hello?' 'I got it, David
Sorry about that
' She started to laugh
I didn't really understand why at first, it was actually kind of odd for Rachel to be laughing so much, but I just started talking
'I'm kind of aggravated, tonights not going well
' She then sounded very consirned
'Not going well? What's wrong?' Although she DID sound a little different
She sounded a bit like
Holly! Heh, that's funny
'It's just
you don't sound like yourself
Is that you?' 'Uh
yeah it's me
Rachel?' She then laughed again
And it was confirmed that that WAS NOT RACHEL
'Oh MAN! It's HOLLY, huh!' 'Yes
this is Holly!'   LOL! Oh man, that's SO CLASSIC! Imagine what she would of thought, calling me, hearing me pick up with 'ARRRR!' and her she must of instantly though I knew who she was when she called, even though she must have had no way of knowing! That's great! We talked about it later, how funny it was, and I told her what she called for
her grade on the english test
It really pearked me up
Holly and I didn't talk for that long, but it was such a funny mix up
I was so sure it wash her
Simply becuase of it being 9:10
Even though Holly and Rachel sound really nothing alike
ah, such a funny mix up
Well yeah, that's all tonight, folks
I hope my story made you laugh a little, it really cheered me up
Have a ball! Have two! Three!
Fucking christ again
I just spent the last two hours working to transfer my site to another blog hosting service in the hope that I could make the thing look a bit more professional, a bit more dynamic
But in frustration, Ive given up
Whats the effort worth?  Alls I want is to have a background picture, to find a graphics-based blog site
One, of course, that I dont have to pay for
Anyone out there a pro at using Squarespace?  I got really into developing one there, but the real meat of it was lost to me
I couldnt make it any more fancy than this one
So fuck it
and too, theres more important things to do today than waste away before the computer
Sometimes I wish I had a skateboard
Or that I had the trust in myself to throw on my blades
Theres some things Id like to do in town that I fear Im unable to on account of being crippled
Walking it is just so far yet Can you imagine me on a skateboard?  Id be semi-lodged in a gutter somewhere at the bottom of a hill
Knowing me, Id go at it as if I still could negotiate a half-pipe
And end up looking like a sad old lady with child-like scraped knees and elbows
No more ego-strutting at this age
The body is far too worked
Im worried about Kelly
Is she ok?  Can I help?  Send her something to make a few moments of her day a bit better?  Poor dear
Ok, so here's my predicament: I need a predicament
Confusing? Maybe
From the time I was just 12 years old, I promised myself I would never loose myself to that  thing  so famously named  teen angst
But after such a rolling journey towards the BEGINNING of adulthood, I find myself needing an excuse for being so confused
WHA? Simply, I need confirmation for my constant anxiousness, so I shook hands with teen angst and invited it into my crazy world
The sheer incomprehensibility of this post should be proof enough that I AM INSANE
The end
Commence rant:   Theres a reason I left the band, and it became readily apparent last night
I don't get along with 75% of the band at any given time
They don't respect the drummers awesome abilities and have no concept of how long and arduous recoding can be
And the fact that if I don't have to be around my roommate I won't be cause I can't stand his ways
I'm going to start making a list of all the insipid questions my father asks me in a given period of 24 hours
My feeling is that he has like 10 of them stored an hour and if you aren't there for that hour, they carry over
I've already defeated Metal of Honor: Killing J***  Solid game, just wish there was more to it
Of course when you play about 6 hours a night cause you can't sleep, things seem to move quicker
My roommate is going down to school for New Years
Originally I thought it was to just drink but the real reason is he wants to get gifts from his girlfriend
And I'm sick of hearing updates about her broken vagina
That and I'm not too sympathetic to his cries of not getting any
On the bright side I got a Christmas card from a girl I knew few years ago and she wants to catch up
I go into this with a bit of skepticism but it was a nice gesture none the less
Hey Rob, I am going to start As I lay Dying tomorrow, I'm not sure if we will have any more time for discussions, but I would certainly love to talk about the book
Discussions are great, as long as people are interested in talking about a book
I personally recommend everyone to read 'Fountainhead
' Every time I come back to reading this book it elevates me to a totally different level of understanding of life, it's so crazy, it's like a philosophy book but the only philosophy is in the lives of the people that are in the book, I mean it's just great! You have to read it, there are no words of explanation for this masterpiece
People 'die with every day that passes
When you meet them, they're not what you met last
In any given hour, they kill some part of themselves
They change, they deny, they contradict - and the call it growth
At the end there's nothing left, nothing unreversed or unbetrayed; as if there had never been an entity, only a succession of adjectives fading in and out on an unformed mass
This isn't my summer story, I'll do that later but I just wanted to post and make sure that this site wasn't dead cause I got another 'Are you dead?' feedback
And I was tired of seeing Bateman's stoopid story at the top
So anyways here's some feedback I got lately
Ben Brill writes
'uhh, horkins does anyone actually read this? I hope so cause there a quite a  few hours of work here
add me to MSN if you've got it'  Actually yeah
Anyone does actually read this
In fact you proved yourself that you, being anyone actually read this
And I'll add you fa'reaaal
The Ian Bateman FAn Club writes
'Bateman's story fucking sucked
That was the worst fucking story'  No
You're the worst story
shut up wang chung
bored with nothing better to do writes
'Wow -- an enitre week with no posts, during the school year to boot! Is FOL a  thing of the past? Please tell me that at least one of your 'cult' members  still participates in this once-enlightened project! Please tell me that  Flounder isnt dead!'  You sound like a girl
are you a girl? If so, tell brooker's old girlfriend to post again
That was hot
And I'm not dead
probably farouk writes
'Yea, so i was checking your website out and it seemed pretty slick
Mainly  about random school shiat and stuff ya know
However, I think there should be  more of a weekend adventure story, kinda like indiana jones ya know?(Real  life) Rolling a couch down yonge - eglington tied to a back of an odyssey van ,  Going to a bar and realizing after a while that there are no chicks in there (  gay bar), Hitting on a hot blonde chick until you hear her speak and find out  she's a dude, shiat like that
You need some crazy shiat up here and if you want I'm willing to write my  weekend adventures from the past and present for ya
It's pretty crazy mind  you
My name will remain to be a mystery until eventually someone figures it out  I guess
'  THis sounds like Farouk
He's saying weird shit trying to be ghetto
'Shiat'??? Said that one like
thrice
And while that sounds like quite an adventure, I just don't know if it's FOL material
Sorry Farouk
And if your not Farouk, stop being like farouk, its bad for you
And he's brown what up with that?  til next time  P34[3 (peace)
Reporting for Iraq Blog Count duty
Ready and willing
Yet Another Early out   Today we got out early again
So I had Jadie come over and we watched the movie  Undisputed
The movie was okay, but who am I to judge
im not Ebert or Roper or whoever they are
As I was taking Jadie home just about 10 minutes ago, some frickin moron just about ran into us
Some lady was turning right, off the highway, and into the  urlLink Hy-Vee  parking lot
But she was stupid and wasn't paying attention and about hit me while I was waiting to turn out of the parking lot! I bit my tongue so as to not unleash my fury of big words and swearing onto her and just let it go
No biggie right?
So now I'm taking Beginning Debate
Watch out-I recommend avoiding getting into arguments and political debates with me
I'll kick your ass
lol  I already know that I'll have some bones to pick with a few people in my class
They're both staunch republicans, and one can't even come up with 3 good reasons (that aren't based on faulty CIA intelligence
) why George W
Bush should be elected this November
He couldn't come up with 3
like there even are 3
As for today:  I was late for MITY and missed the opening convocation because my car broke down (you know, the red Ford Fuckus ZX5)
There were some problems with the fuel exhaust recirculation system, so when you tried to start the car it would turn over and quit
So, my dad took forever (as usual) in getting the other car driven a mile away from our house (literally)
After the switch, avoiding some traffic and some detours, I got to Macalester at 9:00
As it turned out, on the contrary to my guess, Debate is in Olin Rice Science hall, at the far south end of the campus, whereas I thought it would be held in Carnegie Hall
Too bad-Carnegie is closer to everything on Campus
You probably have no clue of what I'm talking about, so just pay a visit to the Macalester Liberal Arts College campus on Grand Ave
Paul sometime
It's a nice place
After MITY: 1
Played some ultimate frisbee, got dirty
Drove to Blimpie Subs in St
Paul, and got shitty service
The guy didn't know how the fuck to make a turkey, ham, and salami on Sesame Seed without cheese
Drove to Saxon Ford to pick up the red Fuckus, decided not to go to Bike practice tonight
Instead I mowed a lawn that was 12 inches tall
I swear on it
Now: pack a lunch, sleep
In that order
My head is killing me again
For the last week, I've had a headache every day
More often than not I can 'drown' my headache by drinking a liter or 2 of water, and then keeping up with whatever comes out again, but not today
I'm guessing it's because of my cold - sleeping with your mouth open to be able to breath, but loosing a lot of water in the mean time
I don't want to take pain killers to much, but I've given in again today
Not that it helps much, though ibuprofen works a lot better for me than paracetamol or aspirin
Right now it's a 4 (see the  urlLink Kip scale )
I tried keeping a headache log for a while, but nothing much of a pattern came up
I know it's not cluster headaches (see  urlLink headache types ) or hormone headaches, or migraine headaches
I'm thinking tension headache - but that doesn't prevent the problem
Oh well, I'll have to live with it, painfull though as it is
Finally after a long bumpy ride'almost like phuking'  on SQ246 on the morning of 28th i am Home! Nice to be home
but immediately my sensitive nose became itchy runny
skins start itch abit too
well i guess its the pollution from the neighbouring countries again
Before coming back,
yesterday i went shopping at Harbour town
and managed to get a bargain of Mambo T-shirts!   Mambo Bargain!       after that we went to eat japanese food at Goldcoast
its was pretty good and genuine, the place was jammed packed
After dinner we embarked on long journey up the scary road to Natural Bridge Park to witness the spectacular Glow Worms in the cave with waterfall inside
Yeah it was like having many bright blue stars in the cave
beautiful! but too bad we cant take photo of it
The glow worms are sensitve to lights
so if you guys are going there
pls refrain from using lights inside the cave
Its late now
better go sleep lor
and dream of what delicious local food i shall eat tomorrow!

Alwaize makes me grow stronger…=)  Hmmm… listening to BoA’s cd again… I realli like her song “Song with no name” n of coz “Love & Honesty”… Yea… I like the fast songs too… but not realli in the mood now… I dunno wad’s wrong with me… I haven’t realli been in the mood for anything lately… n I juz keep staying at home staring into space… sleeping… pigging out… watching Jap VCD’s… Sheesh… wad the hell is wrong with me?

My middleman responded:       'This is not a hoax
I talked to Larry and Sergey about your ad, and what they like about your ad was that you were using their passion - the internet - to try and get a date with them
I will forward your picture to them, if you like, and let us see how it goes
Knowing them though, I would say this picture is not likely to do you good
They are more likely to be interested in someone who was either conservatively dressed - or - on the other extreme, someone bold enough to send a naughty pic
Let me know if you still want to send this one
'      A few things:     1
I have no idea if this guy was for real or not; therefore, please do not assume anything (for example: that the middleman actually knows anyone who I might want to go on a date with, that the middleman is actually a man, that Larry ever knew about my little ad or took the time out of his busy Googler schedule to make a comment to the middleman about it)!  Remember, this blog is in no way associated with Google even if the purpose of the blog is to  become  associated with people at Google
If they liked an ad on Craiglist they should freaking love a BLOG!    3
Only a foolish man would refuse a date with hot (and brilliant) girls like Liz and me
This was the first that I told Liz about my quest for our dates
She thought I was crazy; I demanded she send conservative pictures as soon as possible
urlLink     Coool

GMAIL: 1 GB YAHOO: 100 MB  Confession: I have a Gmail account
the 1 GB utopia that is unleashing a new kind of frenzy on the internet
Though Yahoo has made public announcements on the 100 MB space my yahoo account is still the old 6 MB
Yahoo plans to implement the 100 MB space only in the summer!  Here are some of the interesting things that I thought make sense:  1
On  urlLink CNET
com  I read an article that said - GMail will be reading all the email that flows in and out of the GMail mailboxes
On further investigation from the GMail help pages, here is what I gathered - 'No humans will read the content of your email in order to target such advertisements or related information
'  This is talking about a technology called Ad-Sense that makes it possible for advertisers to target specific email campaigns based on the text of emails that a person sends or receives
Also, through the magic of 'Family-Safe' ads, only safe ads will be sent out to the consumers
Ad-Sense and Family Sense technologies being a Black Box, I really don't know what is happening inside
I personally don't have a problem with machines reading my email till I am not spammed against my wishes
The privacy policies of GMail seem good and promise not to sell any PII
'Privacy International' is going after the GMail
Looks like GMail is now BIG enough to warrant attention and law suits :) After all, it is only big fish that yields meat
California State Senator  urlLink http://www
internetnews
com/bus-news/article
php/3339451'>Liz Figueroa  author of 'Do-Not-Call legislation' is also  in fray to 'warn' people of the dangers of GMail
My concern is that lawyers force technology companies to become more of a lawyer firm than a technology firm that it started with
Google might one day find a law suit so big on their chest that it will decide to throw out the 'rotten apple' from its basket
Till today, no email service has proved to be economically justifiable
Hotmail, Yahoo or any other
Email is something that is retained to keep the consumers coming to their e-commerce portals even if the company is loosing money in hoards
So the rule should be, lesser the space, lower the losses
IF GMail is to sustain the 1 GB limit, I really think that they have to come up with something more justifiable, something that looks like a business model
Is GMail a pre-IPO gimmick to get people excited on google? Given that GMail is tom-tomming about the BETA aspect, when it goes lives the promised space would be missing due to 'sustainability' issues
MOST IMPORTANTLY, what happens to my other email accounts that all my friends and family know? It is unlike the Cell Phone no
that can remain constant even when one switches operators
If I get a GMail account today (till the IPO is hugely over subscribed and Google gets the money), my friends might find a return mail in their mailboxes if they write to me @gmail
com post the IPO
The two features that I find cool about GMail: - Google search to look up information in my mailbox
Currently, there is NO better search technology than Google
It remains to be seen though how dedicated that technology will be to the GMail mailboxes
- Preview feature of GMail that is not available in Web Based emails
Though, my favourite MS Office Outlook does give me that feature!!!  The fact remains that GMail AMAZES me
both from the mind blogging space if offers and the business model they are going after (that might be a trade secret)
Till the dust settles
I am not swimming with the sharks
: I am making this post using the new email based blogging support recently introduced
'The most wonderful thing in life is to be delirious and the most wonderful kind of delirium is being in love
'  -- Yevgeny Zamyatin
Okay, this is weird
This new interface is like baffling the hell out of me
Well, I figure if Blogger can clean up their posting interface, I might as well clean myself up
Grammar  and punctuation wise
Haha! I mean, it's the least I can do
Plus typing like I did before made me look stupider than I really am
We can't have that now, can we?   Lately I've been having some weirdass flashbacks
Like I was young and had good intentions, but I remember my mom was going through some crap about her weight
So this one time I was like,  'Hey Mom, it doesn't matter how fat you are, I still love you
'  She told me,  'Oh,  thanks  Timmy
'  You have to realize that a 6 year old does not know what  sarcasm  is
I mean, I took it as oh hey she appreciates my semi-compliment
It took many years later to realize that she was being a smartass about it and in no way intended to like what I said
That is  NOT  cool Mom
It's also funny how sarcasm has become a part of my life
I think it's all her fault
There was this other time, in elementary
I was chillin' at recess, you know, loving nature and stuff
So I pick up my rollie pollie friend in my hand and I'm like,  'Hey man, how's it going?'  And the meanest ass girl from Africa comes up to me
She was a long-time rival of mine, I don't know why, but I never liked her
She picked on my poor ass too much
Anyway, she goes,  'What is that?'  So I hold my hand out and I say,  'It's a rolli-'   BAM!  She knocks that crap towards my face and guess where Mr
Rollie Pollie goes? That's right, in my mouth
Down my damn throat
One of these days, I'm gonna get her
Sleep with one eye open
I remember this one weirdass dream I had when I was about 6
Whoooo it was a spooky one! I think my mom forced me to wash my sheets, something about me being dirty, and so she took my sheets and threw them in the washer
So it gets pretty late
She tells me to go get them out of the washer  cus  because they're done, but I'm too lazy
I decided that it would be okay to fall asleep on my matress and have no worries about fumbling with sheets or comforters or pillows
I woke up pretty early in the morning
Or at least I thought I woke up
See, my night-light was on, illuminating one wall and casting some SPOOKY shadows
And all of a sudden, I'm levitating, towards my door, into the hallway towards what should've been the living room, only it was infinitely black
And like other dreams, you try to scream but nothing comes out
And then I'm back on my bed
Cheese and rice I'm getting chills thinking about it
So remember kids, always listen to your mother and  PUT YOUR DAMN SHEETS ON YOUR BED
Oh yeah, I remember this other time, I was being a geek and I was like up at 2 in the morning boring people with my dreams
Oh, wait, that's not a flashback, it's a flashnow
Well, my summer as I know it is nearing it's end
Thanks to band
Because Nimitz has the best band program in the universe
Shyeah, right
No, really, there is the need to start summer band early because
oh, I can feel it
yeah, we're gonna get straight one's this year at UIL
Like that's really gonna happen
This band hasn't gotten a 1 since 1999
I mean at least my other school won shit occasionally

Listen to my prayer spoken without guile                                              By Scott    i bought a pair of nice expensive shoes on friday
recently i have broken up with my girlfriend and have been frequenting bars and parties to validate my score on the gender scale
a classy young professional woman who must have impressed me made a remark that has stuck with me for the course of the week: 'He looks like he cares about things
' she said it w/r/t a man we saw while peoplewatching, and although she would never be as careless as to use the term 'metrosexual,' this neologism gives you the idea
so i decided to buy some nice expensive shoes
i would begin to care about things, too
the following night i wore my new shoes out to a friend's birthday party
i was all set to show them off
giving them a good scrub before i left, i had a bounce in my step, no doubt from the great care i imagined a small european man with suspenders put into the craftmanship of their soles
i arrived, got buzzed in, and climbed the three floors of stairs to be greeted by not by a friendly hello but instead by a yellow post-it on the door
It read 'Please remember to take off your shoes
' I noticed the hallway littered with pumps, sneakers, go-go boots, even some nice expensive shoes crafted in a similar manner as mine
I knocked on the door and stepped in
'please take off your shoes,' my host asked me, reiterating the post-it
'we don't want to disturb our downstairs neighbors
' i looked at all the shoes in the hallway, and was going to respond 'well why have 50 people in your apartment getting drunk if you are concerned about your neighbors,' but this host didn't know me very well, i knew the birthday girl, his roommate, and i wanted to be a good guest and respect his wishes
so, the shoes came off
after all, i reasoned,  urlLink how often do you really look at a man's shoes
i heard about the 'uninviteds' from the host, toward the end of the party
he had just spoken to three drunk men from 'the neighborhood,' who tried to crash the party, easing their way into the foyer of the apartment, sniffing their noses high, like booze hounddogs
the host had nicely told them in his friendliest, most patronizing voice, 'sorry guys, the party's winding down
' then he abruptly closed the door on them
he told me this, and a girl with whom he was attending the university with said, 'well handled
' i may not be getting a master's degree, but i know this party host had neglected another principle from the bastion of knowledge we call society yet again
i rushed as fast as i could out of the apartment
of course it was too late
our host 'handled' the situation of three drunk strangers on his doorstep so 'well' that they had made off with over 30 pairs of shoes, including my nice expensive pair
i spun off the bannister, hopping stairs, gaining velocity as i descended
perhaps because of my speed and momentum, i was in a state where saw everything laid out before me, including the next hour in the future
everything that was to happen i already knew to be
i knew i would burst out of the apartment building into the night, that there would shoes awaiting me, that most of the shoes would be abandoned, probably in an asinine place (surely, the middle of the street)
i knew the bandits weren't bandits, they were  urlLink pranksters
and i knew as such the pranksters would return
it was only a matter of waiting
wearing only my left shoe that i found in the street, i waited, poking my head around in trash cans and hedges, hunting for my absconded shoe
i had a lot of time to think about the party host, since i was alone down on the street with my right foot freezing due to the damp pavement, and he was upstairs 'hosting,' a skill which already netted him 5 missing shoes (the rest were recovered by myself and my friends  urlLink Darrell and Gideon , both of whom were fiercely ready to rumble with this party host)
but i saw all of this already
i knew we just had to wait
i thought about asking the party host to pay for my shoes, since justice left the responsibilty for their abduction on his shoulders as well as mine
i thought how, if i was the party host, i would offer
but this party host as i mentioned did not live in a world where shoes are stolen, or worn in the house, or make less noise than the 80s dance jams blaring out the stereo
i decided it's useless to argue with  urlLink someone  so entrenched in a world where you do not see what will be, your prayers are not answered, and you speak only to avoid the guile of others
we grew up differently, i said to myself, and i cannot blame anyone
the pranksters did return, and we gave chase, but i had one shoe, and we knew they didn't have the shoes on them
they made off
if this blog be the place for frustration, for rants, know that i currently wear one shoe and have a sore jaw from grinding my teeth so much
my shoe was found the following morning sleeping beneath a nearby car
of course, i've got to go there to pick it up
I don't know the original source of this but would be glad to give them 'props' if anyone out there does know
Saddam was a good guy when Reagan armed him, a bad guy when Bush's daddy made war on him, a good guy when Cheney did business with him and a bad guy when Bush needed a 'we can't find Bin Laden' diversion
Trade with Cuba is wrong because the country is communist, but trade with China and Vietnam is vital to a spirit of international harmony
A woman can't be trusted with decisions about her own body, but multinational corporations can make decisions affecting all mankind without regulation
Jesus loves you, and shares your hatred of homosexuals and  Hillary Clinton
The best way to improve military morale is to praise the  troops in speeches while slashing veterans' benefits and combat pay
If  condoms are kept out of schools, adolescents won't have sex
Providing  health care to all Iraqis is sound policy
Providing health care to all  Americans is socialism
HMOs and insurance companies have the best  interests of the public at heart
Global warming and tobacco's link to  cancer are junk science, but creationism should be taught in schools
A  president lying about an extramarital affair is an impeachable   offense
A president lying to enlist support for a war in which thousands die is solid  defense policy
Government should limit itself to the powers named in the Constitution, which include banning gay marriages and censoring the Internet
The public has a right to know about Hillary's cattle trades,  but George Bush's cocaine conviction is none of our business
Being a drug addict is a moral failing and a crime, unless you're a conservative radio host
Then it's an illness, and you need our prayers for your recovery
You support states' rights, which means Attorney General John Ashcroft can tell states what local voter initiatives they have the right to adopt
What Bill Clinton did in the 1960s is of vital national interest,  but   what Bush did in the '80s is irrelevant
I got a call from my Mom last night saying that my Grandma (on my late Father's side) had a mild stroke
Physically she is ok (for someone that is 87 years old); but they found her at the neighbors' house demanding to know why she was there
She told them she did not live there, that she lived on Horstmeier Road
She has not lived on Horstmeier since I was in college
that was before I had my kids
before Dad died, etc
She has lost her short-term memory
I guess if they make it to my cousin's wedding she won't know my kids anymore
Try explaining THAT to your 4 and 6 year olds
'Hey kids, you remember great-grandma Cantrell?  Well she doesn't remember YOU
'  And stupid me
I cried most of the way to work this morning thinking about having to explain to her where Dad is
My Aunt and Uncle are trying to find a place for her and Grandpa
He is in poor physical health these days and has barely talked at all since Dad passed
He smiles at my kids, hugs and tickles them
but he won't talk much at all
She can't take care of him anymore by herself
she can't even remember when to take her own meds
much less when he should take his or who's meds are who's anymore
So they are going to try to find some assisted living
something where they still feel like they are somewhat independent, but aren't cooking their meals or messing up meds
It kind of puts a bummer on my day
I really didn't need to start my week that way either
And, in the pointless category of this website
(from CNNSI's daily 'SportsToday' newsletter)  We've all done it -- as kids mostly -- to settle such things as who's gonna get that last piece of pizza
But nobody does it as well as Pete Lovering
The Toronto man is the world's top Rock, Paper, Scissors player -- and he has $1,200, a video game system and a gold medal to prove it
Lovering bested more than 250 adults to win first prize in the World Rock Paper Scissors Society's first international championship last weekend in Toronto
For the uninitiated, RPS, as it's known to players, consists of three simple gestures: A clenched fist (rock), two extended fingers (scissors), and a flat hand with your palm down (paper)
Two players each throw down one of the gestures
A rock smashes scissors, scissors cut paper, and paper covers a rock
While most consider RPS a game of chance, championship co-organizer Douglas Walker said there's more to it
'The patterns start to emerge fairly quickly and the good players know what they're looking for,' he said
'You know by facial expression
Some of them are more concerned with looking at the flexing of the hand
' Exactly, said Lovering
Well, sort of
'I call it mindfulness of being, which is if you think about what your throw's going to be before you throw it, the other player can pick it up,' he told the Ottawa Citizen
'Just focus strictly on what you're going to throw and if you throw what's right for you, it'll be the right answer
Seems I always get on here at night after our meetings - there's my set way
Anyway, another good night
We had a full house tonight - the McGlones were over again - always good to have them hang with us
Matt also visitied tonight for the first time
He found our website and e-mailed me - then he was here tonight
It was good to have him with us
We had alot of fun - talked about 'doing the word' - being more than just someone who does the compartmental 'spiritual' things but one who lives their whole life abiding with Christ - constantly growing and being transformed
We talked a little about the whole notion being discussed by Brian McLaren, Dallas Willard, etc
about being a 'follower of Christ' and not just haing the name 'Christian
' We discussed how this living it out is not being legalistic - that we are cooperating with the work of God in us on a constant basis - loong haul
It was a good talk
That's it for now
Would you stop thinking about your ass for a moment? :-)
So I went out with this guy last night, and he asked the question that will kill anyone's chances of ever touching me in this lifetime
Why hasn't some guy snatched you up already? God I hate that question
He followed it with a good statement, about how it was just unbelievable to him that no one would have scooped me up by now because I was so wonderful
I looked at him and said, 'Stick around and you'll find out,' while making a wide-eyed psycho face
For a second there he thought I was serious, much to my amusement
Pretty much from that second on it was another free meal from some clueless man
Did it ever occur to him that I didn't want to be 'snatched' or 'scooped?'   In unrelated news I was driving listening to this hilarious&nbsp;CD my best friend's hubby made for me with all the stupid hair band songs of the eighties
As I sat at the stop light singing 'Once bitten twice shy' at the top of my lungs, I looked over and saw this gorgeous hunk of a man in a convertible
He looked as though he was about to put his top up out of fear for his life
Maybe it is related
Perhaps this is one of the reasons I'm not married
I watched the Fog of War today
I found it to be an exellent and extremely disturbing film given our current war in Iraq
George W
Bush, I implore you, watch this film
We're not talking about preparing for a trip to England by watching such Hollywood fluff as Master and Commander, here
You may actually learn something
A truly frightening thought:  W has the power to launch all of our nuclear weapons
The decision is his and his alone
The man who is by his own admission anti-intellectual, only reads headlines, sees millions of people protesting his decisions as a focus group and cannot speak in public still controls all of that weaponry
W would rather fuck himself in the ass with Saddam's pistol, than debate and analyse a situation from all points of view
Something else that really struck me, McNamara said that without the support of other countries who shared similar ideologies with the U
, the Vietnam war was doomed from the start
Sound familiar?  There is so much to be said about the film
McNamara's ten lessons and the eleven lessons from the film are a lot to chew on, but oh so simple
Another bonus was the soundtrack by Phillip Glass
I like his compositions
Overall poop rating - 4 poops
Hey man Dick Lee is my new idol now man

got complimented by j on the title of this blog last saturday
he also commented that unlike  urlLink his , my blog was introspective
i replied that my object in this blogging exercise is to get back to the level of writing i had when i was a college freshman
and honestly, introspective is a word i can comfortably describe myself with
from high school till first year college, i'd like to think that i wrote passably well
but since then i've hardly written anything except school papers
i can't pinpoint why i stopped, only that i did
and it turned out to be one of my biggest mistakes
now i'm trying to recover the old magic, as it were
because for me, writing is something i can't do well if i don't keep doing it
how far i've progressed so far, only my readers can tell
I dreamt about Emily's mom last night
I have no idea what she looks like (though I think I have seen a picture at some point), so she had the face of the mom in Pieces of April
I dreamed that I put my hands on her and willed her to live, like Shaedra talks about with her 'raiki' or whatever it is
I had some miraculous healing power in the dream, apparently
And I was doing everything I could to make her get better
I woke up with a wet face and a feeling of complete uselessness
There is nothing I can do
Even normal, day-to-day stuff to help Brooke and Emily out would be great, but what the fuck do you do from 1000 miles away? As usual, I wish I were capable of prayer
Though I don't know if God is a help or a hindrance with real grief, I think s/he would certainly be helpful with 'sending good thoughts
' Sending just my own, unamplified, seems woefully insufficient
My house is very cold, but my tea is very hot, so it all works out
Got lucky on a book-buying spree at the Goodwill today
I picked up a multicultural family book for Susan and Tony, Backlash, Susan Brownmiller's rape book, Amy Tan's newest book, and Molly Ivans' book about the Clinton years
That, along with Janet Frame's autobiography (I have to remember to get that from Susan before I leave) should keep me busy while I'm home
My sense of excitement about going home is pretty repressed now
I'm honestly terrified that my mom is having surgery and that I have to be there and see her through it and stuff
Have to is the wrong way of putting that
I want to, I'm just scared of the responsibility
But at least I have a place to stay in Portland worked out (thanks Sarah!) and hopefully I will be able to make a stock-up swing by Trader Joe's
Wonder if Mark would be mad if a stock-up from Trader Joe's is all he got for Christmas? I'm sort of out of ideas
I need to get the relaxation packs put together
I meant to make some yoga cards for them, but I don't know if I have the energy now
I wonder how much laminating costs at Kinkos?  Obviously I'm just rambling
Mmm, more stream of conciousness blogging
I really want to be able to help Emily and her mom
I can't stop thinking about it
Tonight is the state of the union speech
It will be interesting to hear what whoppers he tells tonight
I am sure there will be some great points to work with
One thing that I have heard that he wants to do and I actually agree with is removing the down payment requirements on FHA financing for houses
It is about time
the down payments have always been the most difficult thing for many to get together
While FHA financing has always had a low down payment percentage it has always still been difficult and the main obstacle for people trying to buy a home
So that I agree with and maybe at some point soon if I ever get well enough I may even be able to afford a house of my own
However the rest of what has been hinted at is just plain bad
Bush wants to extend health care out to more people but it will most likely be another weakening of Medicare and Medicaid with huge handouts to the drug and insurance companies
We all have to keep our eyes and ears open and listen for those buzzwords
because the speech will be packed with them
It is going to be interesting and I am sure I will have something to say about it all
We shall see
I just hope Dean doesn't stumble anymore
because he really is a better candidate than the rest (except Kucinich) and would at least be able to take it to Bush and hold him accountable for what he has done
Oh no!~ it's like a year passed,&nbsp;i didn't update my blog at all
(eg: no new posts,etc
)     I think next time i should put reminders all over my house 2 remind me, but tat will be alot of papers waste, but i dun care so much lah!
Decided to try a new skin
This will look weird/shitty till I get home
There's an image to go across the top, but I haven't put it on my server yet and I don't want to steal bandwidth
Let me know what you think!
My weekend went something like this:  Friday - Trained with Shihan for a solid 2 hours
Wiped me out for the next 3 days, easy
Saturday - Had lunch with my relatives, nothing too exciting
Ended up 'guarding the fort' with Shane (my cousin Carmina's boyfriend) while they went shopping! Oh well, they haven't spent any real time together as a family since Carmina's moved out
Sunday - Nothing of note, my body still hurt from all the sparring!  Monday - I went out shopping for PC speakers and came home with 2 DVDs and 2 new PC games
I briefly contemplated going to see 'The Passion of the Christ', since it was Easter and all
But that changed once I got home and sat in front of my PC - damned tool of the devil!!!  I guess I wanted to accomplish more with my free time, but my body was racked with bruises and pain from the whole week of fighting - I initially wanted to train with Shihan on Saturday and Sunday as well, but I realised in hindsight I would probably be coughing up blood and nursing bruised ribs
I wasn't really looking forward to training hard today coming off the long weekend, and Shihan didn't show because he got caught up with other things
John went through some stuff with me and I'm glad to say I'm picking up a lot of things from him
At this rate, I should be ready come Christchurch in June
:)  Fighting is so much more a mental game than it is physical - John proved that to me by not showing any sign of even being flustered after I hit him with everything I had
Apparently I had winded him good, but he didn't show me
and boy, did I feel useless at the time!  8 1/2 weeks and counting to NZ - make it count, man
It has been quite a week
I finished up my final shift at Impark, thank goodness!  Jay was baptized!  My parents met Jay's parents
I have a lead on a massage job for when I am done school (please pray for me)!!  A dear friend of mine, lost her grandpa to cancer
It just all makes me think a lot about life, and what really matters
I have not experienced death of any close friends or relatives
I cannot imagine what my friend's family is experiencing, but I do know that at least they can have hope and peace in knowing that he has gone to a better place
A place where there are no more tears or pain
Reminds me of a verse written by Paul in Philippians 1:21, 'For to me to live is Christ and to die is gain
'  John D
definitely lived his life for Christ, what passion that man had!   I was thinking of their family as I rode the bus this morning listening to my discman
The song I Can Only Imagine by Mercy Me came on and I was welling up with tears and people were giving me funny looks, so I had to skip it ahead to the next song
That is such an amazing song, and when I think of being in heaven, wow, I become awed at the very thought!  I don't deserve to go to heaven, but through Jesus' sacrifice on the cross we are able to
And after seeing the Passion earlier this year, it just breaks my heart
Jesus did THAT for me!  And he would do it again in an instant, he loves us that much
And I whine about getting up 'early' to go to church on Sunday mornings ('but it's my only day to sleep in')
I think I need to get my priorities straight
Because a person never knows when your time will come, when God will call us home
I Can Only Imagine by MercyMe  I can only imagine what it will be like, when I walk by Your side
I can only imagine, what my eyes will see, when Your Face is before me! I can only imagine
I can only imagine
Surrounded by Your Glory, what will my heart feel? Will I dance for you, Jesus? Or in awe of You, be still? Will I stand in Your presence, or to my knees will I fall? Will I sing 'Hallelujah!'? Will I be able to speak at all? I can only imagine! I can only imagine!   I can only imagine, when that day comes, when I find myself standing in the Son! I can only imagine, when all I will do, is forever, forever worship You! I can only imagine! I can only imagine!   Surrounded by Your Glory, what will my heart feel?   Will I dance for you, Jesus? Or in awe of You, be still? Will I stand in Your presence, or to my knees will I fall? Will I sing 'Hallelujah!'? Will I be able to speak at all? I can only imagine! Yeah! I can only imagine!   Surrounded by Your Glory, what will my heart feel?   Will I dance for you, Jesus? Or in awe of You, be still? Will I stand in Your presence, or to my knees will I fall? Will I sing 'Hallelujah!'? Will I be able to speak at all? I can only imagine! Yeah! I can only imagine!   I can only imagine! Yeah! I can only imagine!! Only imagine!!! I can only imagine
I can only imagine, when all I do is forever, forever worship You! I can only imagine

My throat feels slightly better
last night it was killing me
Sometime before Tuesday morning I have to write an English essay and think about writing several history essays for a test that I am sure to do poorly on
I don't think I've left the house this weekend, how sad
I still feel crappy
I still hate school

Furthermore, there's no way they  could  remove the clause from the pledge
It's no technicality - the man who wanted it removed 'for his daughter' is not in legal control of her at all
They are in the middle of a custody battle between the man and his wife, who wants her daughter to say the pledge, 'under God' inclusive
Not only would the removal of all notion of religion being removed from America as we know it cause legal reindoctrination of all who say the pledge, but furthermore reprinting of billions of dollars, not to mention a horrid revamping of all and everything associated with timekeeping, especially since many days and months were named after gods and whatnot, and we surely can't have that
Rename the planets, chuck out the Declaration of Independence while we're at it, or at least slice it up and take out 'all men are created equal, that they are  endowed by their Creator  with certain unalienable Rights' and 'with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence
'   Beyond this, nobody's forcing you to say the pledge, so settle down, cheech
I'm not sure I ever saw Lade say it, and Wang told us he didn't
Not to mention how Nick Nathan deliberately left out the clause himself, which is his own matter of opinion not to mention just being retarded, and also threw off our canter, especially El Jefe till he learned to ignore him
May I remind you this is also the guy who ran around the room hectically throwing out pencils
That was hilarious
Furthermore, this God is the same that is admittedly followed by no less than 78

BF and I went to a baseball game last night
I am a huge sports fan
BTW, the battle of the wits ended on a good note
He emailed me first (per usual) and things are just fine
We had a good discussion last night about relationships and about ex's
My ex is going to be at a party I'm hosting on Friday (and so will my new bf)
I wanted to give him the heads up--not to cause drama, but to dampan any drama that might occur when I awkwardly  introduce them to each other
Bonus points for my bf who talked about the freedom of letting go of your feelings from a past relationship (His ability to 'let go' is a sign that he will not become an obsessive stalker)
yay!  I IMd with my bro (who also happens to be my best friend) yesterday about 'The Gift of Fear'
He laughed at me
Which I guess it a good thing
he thinks I need to 'relax'
I do have a problem of thinking too much--but it's better to be safe than sorry! For now, I will put my fear of being stalked by my bf on the back-burner
and focus on the hear and now/reality of our relationship
Good thing I have my bro to keep me in check
My upcoming weekend is going to be full of parties! hurrah!! But this is also the last weekend my bf is in town
At least he'll be leaving on an 'up!' note full of social fun!

katie moore  you might notice that none of my old girlfriends are on this list
this illuminates my earlier contention about not  dating the right people
A Crime of Passion   I told XX yesterday that when he gets a gf, I will shoot her, shoot him, then shoot myself
He said, 'Is that really worth going to jail for?' and I said, 'You're not listening to me
I said that I would kill her, kill you, then kill myself! I wouldn't BE in jail if I was DEAD!' The worst part of this whole thing is that we work in the same office
I was warned twice not to 'dip my nib in the office ink' but I dipped anyway because I was bored and horny
Oh well, this morning I have applied to three jobs so far
If any good comes out of all this pain and this empty sad feeling in my stomach is that I'm gonna get outta Dodge
And by Dodge, I mean Emeryville, CA
For some sordid details, I will tell you that he said our relationship was getting too serious and moving too quickly
He doesn't want to commit to anyone and doesn't want to be anybody's boyfriend
Blah-blah-blah, yada-yada-yada
A lot of nice things were said too, but I blocked them out because essentially in my heart of hearts, I think he wants to sow his wild oats
He wants to sleep around some more before settling down
I may be off the mark, but that's what I feel instinctually in my gut
And he basically said that he doesn't like me that much
Oh well
Sometimes I want to yell, 'YOU'RE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE!!! YOU'RE GOING TO REGRET THIS!!!' but I've lived and loved enough to know that that's just stupid
I've got some pride left
And I know you can't force someone to love you no matter how awesome you are or how much make-up you wear
And, if you do get back together, you will doubt yourself the whole time anyways
And you will want to hurt them the way they hurt you
I know all this
That's why I said he could still give me his CD burner before I totally cut him off
Who says women make decisions based on emotions? I'm awed by my amazing rationale
He says he still wants to be friends and 'get together' sometimes, but I passed on the idea
Because who wants to sleep with someone you're in love with who doesn't love you back? That's the shittiest dynamic ever
That's too sleazy for me; because underneath the steely glare and venomous comments, I'm a mushy romantic
I'm going to wait for someone who will be in love with me too
I think that's something worth waiting for
i'm in shock right now
I'm okay, just kind of in shock
I lost a dear friend today, but
but she would always speak of her death so it's not a complete surprise, I've thought of it several times before, it's just surprising
i'm being completly honest here
I'm not using any dramatic-ness, kind of unlike me, huh? I was thinking of just being like
today I walk down a black sprial or something like that, but you know what, there's no sence in it
The only reason to talk like that is to get pity, and I don't want pity for myself
Not at all
I want pity for Danielle Butterfield, a girl who only got a taste of life before throwing it away
It's so sad
she was very happy as a child, but the downs in her life
they were so overpowering
she talked about her death on many occations, I thought about it often, but
I don't know
I guess I'm still pretty shocked
and hungry

Second night fun

I had a good day today
First I got to wake up next to Crys for the second day in a row
how great is that? I was smiling like crazy this morning
Anyway, when G man(who threw his back out, I&nbsp;wish him a speedy recovery)&nbsp;and I got home from doing hay with Monz(who had to pick his mom up and didn't get to see Krissy today, I feel really bad for him), they were about to leave
It sucked, but I was just glad I got to see them today
We were talking about the both of them moving in last night, and the more I think about that idea, the better it seems to me
But, onto the rest of my day
I went to sleep not long after they left, and woke up a little after one
I listened to beats for the next couple hours and had no crative spurs
Then Almanzo walked in and asked me if I wanted to go milk with him
I said I would and the rest is history
I figured out that I have a huge phobia of cows, or at least being kicked
I would say that I did ok for a dopey Fonda kid's first time out
Almanzo was right though, Russ goes right for the shovel when it comes to keeping the bovine in line(rhyming
where was that at 2:30 today?)
Anyway, I've had a long day, and I'm tired as hell
Goodnight
Mood: Happy, I got to see Crys again
Currently Playing: Nothing, Manz is watching a movie in my bedroom though
Some blogs are extremely personal; the author constantly refers to themself and their immediate surroundings, and dictates the goings-on and inside knowledge of their day
Others are the opposite, where the author discusses world events or (my favorite) random observations about life itself that can be applied to anyone
I'd like to think that  Crap from My Life  is a comfortable medium, with a healthy balance between the two extremes
Though, if I had to say that I lean one way or the other, it's probably gonna be in that personal direction
Because you all know how selfish I am
Harry Potter 3 was really good
The new director made some obivous changes, and I think they were for the better
He left a lot of stuff out that was in the book, and things that were pretty important, but did an overall good job
The neat camera angles and panoramic shots were pretty tight, and the sequence in which Harry flies on Buckbeak (if you haven't read the book, see the movie and you'll know what I mean) is quite thrilling; it made me happy and smile just to watch that part
The one complaint I had was that there was not enough revelation and sentimentality such as was present in the book as Harry was learning about his father's past at Hogwarts
The scene where he learns the truth about Peter and Sirius and hears of some of his afther's exploitations
it just didn't grip and engage and make me want to hear more as the book did
In the movie, they don't even explain Harry's patronus, or who Moony, Padfoot, Wormtail and Prongs were
Wtf? Those are critical pieces of information
Also, there was no inter-house Quidditch Cup
Harry like, totally  won  that for his team in this book
Whatever
Pam is home!  I think  urlLink this  is how I want to die

But you'll make me want to if you don't click it, dammit!  Tomorrow I can finally sleep past 8:25!  In 24 hours I will be seeing/have just seen Dashboard Confessional at Relient Arena
Hey, they have a song on the  Spider-Man 2  soundtrack (which, by the way, looks like an  awesome  movie)
that's cool
Complete and utter mainstream, here we come
Now, I'm not hardcore emo and exclusive in the music I listen to; I am hardly hardcore anything
But now eeeeveryone will know Dashboard and jump on the bandwagon which I so gratefully did last summer
Well I guess it's a good thing then: more people can share the joy and also angst I garner in my soul from listening to their music
Hooray for The Shins as well!  Yeah, this was a healthy medium and balance, if I do say so myself
God bless
My office didn't have Internet for essentially 99 percent of the workday
It was hysterical to watch people justify their lack of work (myself included) because of the Internet being down
What did people do before the Internet? I really have no idea
An old woman in my office was noted to tell a coworker with regards to a magazine cover, 'Look at this Lindsay Lohan
17, and look at these knockers!' I laughed my ass off
Gagne finally blew a save
In reality, I don't care - the Dodgers still suck, except for Milton Bradley and Adrian Beltre
While Gagne is an amazing closer, he already killed this record, and at some point it had to end
it's just a shame it had to be to the DBacks, managed by Mets retread Al Pedrique
I'm glad Edwards got picked, because in reality, could you see Tom Vilisack as President of the United States?  There's a segment on SportsCenter where some high school senior committed to Duke e-mailed Coach K about how much Coach K means to Duke
Apparently, this swayed the decision
I'm sure the fact that the Lakers will suck next year also swayed the approach; I must admit though, the segment has tug-at-the-heartstrings potential
Last night, I read a book called 'What Your Sixth Grader Needs to Know' which contained a diverse section on American history
It's amazing how stupid I am, in that I understood the Vietnam war better from a 3 paragraph description than I did from the months I covered it in HS social studies / history classes
I watched a segment on ABC about life in the minor leagues last night
Amazing
Did you know Mitch Williams is the coach of the Atlantic City Surf? Amazing

i've been sitting hetre for a HOUR and I haven't done anything
my mind is so blagh
so I'm blogging again
You know, I went to the Trig teachers class room this morning before school started only to find out that she was in a meeting
And because of that, she didn't come to the classroom while I was there which means I would have been late to my Homeroom if I didn't leave when I did
How great is that, right?  Anyway, today wasn't so bad
Though it was a bit boring and I was dozing off in Physics today, it wasn't to bad
The school computer dude finally got our logins working so we can now get in to the school network there and do some actual web design work
Plus, I have some homework that is not due until Monday which means I get a free day in those classes tomorrow, Yeah!  Besides today, tonight hasn't been bad for homework either
I managed to type a really good, or what I think is really good, essay for class tomorrow
(I'm one of those last minute doers
lol) So i hope i get some good comments about it and a good grade
Otherwise, I am screwed! LOL! Anyway, I am going to go now
Later!    Wolfwood
I'm always reading six different books or more
Actually, I'm seriously going through front to back about three, and I find I've got another set that make up a sort of research fad, as I thumb through them several times a day as I write or whatever
In fact, I've opened up a whole bookshelf for the temperary rotation slot in an effort to rid my house of my many stacks of book fads
Maybe because I'm always reading multiple texts, and maybe b/c I, like Phil, don't have Google squatting behind my eyes, I've turned into a person who makes a lot of reading notes
I've got pages of word docs in disorganized spots on my hard drive from times that I actually make notes as I go through these books
Lately, I've been thinking of making a seperate blog--I wanted to call it booknotes or the margin or some such similarly quippy name--just to organize and share these notes
And damn it if Phil didn't beat me to it!    urlLink Phil Gyford: Writing: External scaffolding : 'I’m a forgetful man
I could tell you the names of most people in my classes at school or college, but when it comes to the contents of books or plots of films I’m usually stumped
I’ve often wondered whether it’s worth plodding through several hundred pages of a non-fiction book when a couple of weeks later I might only remember a couple of ideas
I deeply, deeply envy people who can rattle off quotes and references as if Google is squatting behind their eyes
So, in an effort to make something, anything, stick, I’ve started taking notes when I read non-fiction books
A few post-it notes nestled inside the cover are a convenient place to scribble thoughts and summaries
Later I type these up so I can still read them in the future, so I can search them, so I can back them up, and in the hope that the repetition will hammer a few more facts into place
Given I have the notes in digital form I thought I might as well put them online; a couple of hours work in setting the weblog up means I can access my notes from anywhere and search them easily, making them a much more accessible form of external scaffolding (a term I picked up from Small Pieces Loosely Joined)
There’s always a chance someone else will find them useful too
Having only done three books so far it’s hard to tell how things will settle down (assuming I keep this going), but I expect the notes will be a mixture of the points I found most interesting and attempts at a complete summary
We’ll see how it goes
Ok, this is NOT written in stone yet, but I  belieeeeeve  I have a new home in LA!  It was a few moments last night when everything was just so, just perfect
I sent an email to a lovely young lady my age whose roomie is taking off at the end of this month; she happened to be online and wrote me right back
It was the sweetest letter, clearly a good person, 'so happy' to hear from me! She wrote her number and I just called her that moment, and we clicked immediately
I was excited and I might've sounded a little goofy on the phone :P, but she didn't bat an eye
Puddy Tat is more than welcome, rent is perfect @ $500 for a br and bath in her 2br, 2 bath apt

It is with great sadness that I learnt of the tragic helicopter accident in Sierra Leone of the UN Mi 8 aircraft and the loss of 24 lives
I have travelled extensively in UN aircraft and had the unfortunate experience of being an Air Ops Duty Officer when two of their aircraft were 'lost' due to hostile action
The pilots and staff of the UN do a magnificent job in the world's most hostile environments - it's just a shame that the media coverage (ticker tape on ITV news on cable)does not do their efforts justice
Or maybe, it's just that Sierra Leone is now passe?

President Bush said, 'This administration never said that the 9/11 attacks were orchestrated between Saddam and al Qaeda
We did say there were numerous contacts between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda
' But he is playing semantic games which distort undisputable facts
Top officials in the Bush administration – including the president and the vice president – have repeatedly cited a collaborative relationship - not just contacts - between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda as a justification for invading Iraq
Now, after months of careful study, the bi-partisan commission investigating 9/11 says there is no credible evidence to support that claim

The Ducks Are In The Barrel
by Bill Plaschke It begins when he takes his first step onto the Dodger Stadium outfield grass, leaving the infield and trotting toward the hot corner from hell
'Bar-ry sucks, Bar-ry sucks
' It continues when he reaches the worn patch of outfield grass ringed by the expectorated shells of sunflower seeds
'BAL-CO, BAL-CO, BAL-CO
' He stares into the wide eyes of the left-field corner and pavilion crowds, and the crowds scream back
'Ster-oids, ster-oids
' He flexes his left arm, forming a biceps and a smirk, and they scream louder
'Juice, juice, juice
' It continues like this for an entire half-inning, for nine half-innings, for a dozen years now, with an emotion as raw as it is resilient, with voices so filled with hatred one can almost feel the respect
One of the greatest players in baseball history may be the most booed visiting player in Los Angeles sports history
Except, of course, for those moments just before Barry Bonds actually swings his bat
'Excuse me a second,' says Gilbert Chavez, a Whittier city employee sitting among the suddenly silent masses in the Dodger Stadium left-field pavilion Tuesday night
'I have to watch him hit
' It's like throwing mud on the Mona Lisa
It's like jeering a monument
They might as well be chanting, 'The Grand Canyon sucks, the Grand Canyon sucks
' Did anybody ever sing like this to Michael Jordan? Joe Montana never heard such music, did he? Yeah, and we all remember when hockey fans would mockingly chant, 'Gretz-ky, Gretz-ky
' Didn't they? Amid the constant din of disgust Tuesday night during the Dodgers' 2-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants, an usher shakes his head
'Think about it,' he says
'They are chanting that Barry Bonds stinks
You can say a lot of things about Barry Bonds, but does he really stink?'' Of course not
But such is the beauty of one of sports' coolest rivalries, in spawning one of its oddest couplings
The Dodger faithful, who Giant officials say boo Bonds louder and longer than any other fans anywhere, don't care about the numbers
It's about the colors
'Ever since he became a Giant, I've loved ripping Barry Bonds more than I've loved sex!' shouts Eric Martinez, 22
'It's the best thing about coming here!' It's about the rumors
'Hey Barry, you dropped a needle,' scream a couple of fans, again and again
It's about the low pants, the casual posture, the slow gait, the shrugs, a guy who had the nerve to step into this rivalry in 1993 and immediately own it without sweating it
'There's just so much stuff around him,' says Martinez
And so much abuse heaped upon him
'Hey Barry, I see you brought your Sid Bream arm,' shouts one fan with a memory
'Steroids are slowing you down!' shout a dozen other fans
When Bonds catches a ball to end an inning Tuesday, everyone boos
When he drops that ball a few seconds later while casually jogging with it toward the infield, they cheer as if he were Eric Gagne running in from the bullpen
Says Dodger bullpen catcher Rob Flippo: 'It's like a lot of them aren't even watching the game, they're just here to yell at Bonds
' Says David Delfin of El Monte, one of those jeering fans: 'Yeah, well, that's why we get these seats
This is fun
' The chiding of Bonds is so insistent that even the Dodger Stadium organ riffs seem timed to include cursing chants
'It's amazing, they can be playing any song, and the fans can work in a way to sing, 'Barry [bleeps],' ' says Flippo, who sits in the middle of it
The catcalls have become so constant, the Dodgers even notice them from the field
'Oh yeah, that's all they do is ride him,' says Dave Roberts
'It's the one series where nobody else has to worry about being booed
He bears the brunt of everything
' He bears it with a smile, turning to face the crowd between almost every batter
He bears it with humor, flexing his arms and pumping his fists as the boos increase
In the third inning Tuesday, he not only endured it, he promoted it, spreading his arms and lifting his hands as if encouraging the noise to grow
One of the moodiest men in the game seems to be strangely at home in the hot corner from hell
Perhaps because this is one place where he knows exactly where he stands
'Everybody out here also knows what's going on, even if we don't say it,' says fan Chavez
'Everybody rides him, but everybody would love for him to throw us a ball
We say he stinks, but when he hits a home run, we're like, 'Ohhhhhh
' ' And when he comes to the plate? 'Everybody acts like they hate him, but what do they do when the Dodgers don't let him hit?' asks Chavez
Of course
They boo
'Ten years from now, guaranteed, everyone out here will be telling their kids that they saw the great Barry Bonds play,' says Chavez
And, boy, did he 'suck
'   this reminds me of the time dave and i decided to catch a dodgers-giants game
we sat on the field level on the third base side with Barry right in front of us
they gave away noise-makers (aka Thunder Sticks) and for 9 innings straight we banged the hell out of those all the while chanting 'Barry Sucks, Barry Sucks'
such an awesome game, such an awesome rivalry

Health Talk    Strokes are more likely to occur on a Monday, as opposed to any other day of the week, according to a Finnish study published in the July 22 online issue of the journal Stroke
Researchers from the National Public Health Institute of Finland examined the incidence of ischemic stroke by day of the week and its relationship with age, sex, and socioeconomic status (SES)
A ischemic stroke is caused by blood clots that block blood flow to the brain
In their findings, researchers report most strokes occur on Monday with the fewest number of strokes occurring on Sunday
The incidence of ischemic stroke is much higher in persons with low socioeconomic status than in those with high socioeconomic status, the researchers report
The highest incidence of stroke occurred in low income elderly men aged 60 to 74, on Mondays
No Monday excess was observed in persons with high socioeconomic status
'This finding may suggest reasons for the higher IS (ischemic stroke) incidence in persons with low socioeconomic positions and open up some possibilities for prevention,' conclude the authors

Human beings are sometimes so absent minded
A captive Orca turned on his trainer of 10 years and chased him around the performance pool for quite sometime
&nbsp;Now, I mention this because I find it hard to understand that we being animals ourselves although we&nbsp;have evolved (I don't know how) to have the highest level of thinking with our large intricate brains, still have this ballsy misconception that we have the power and right to control this earth and the animals which help us along in this circle of life
If you keep an Orca captive and train it to follow your commands eventually one day you are going to get fucked, it is against the nature of a mammal like the Orca to be held captive away from it's pack/offspring/and home in the great open sea
&nbsp;I am also highly suspicious of any animal (i
dolphin, whale, dog, etc
) which violently attacks it's trainer or owner or any human being for that matter, because I believe that there is a reason for an animals violent actions either it has been provoked, sick, or merely acting out of instinct
You can train an animal all your life but the bottom line is you can not change the animal which I believe lies in all of us
(This is my extremely short version of this all, I could go on and on about what is covered in this tiny paragraph, I am simply putting my two cents out there)
Well, I just finished eating my 2 biscuit breakfast
Now I gotta go brush the hair off my teeth, & comb my shaggy mop of hair
I'm supposed to be at the Augusta Jobshop around 10am
The chick there wants me to fill out an application & talk with her about what kind of jobs they have available
So, if any past indicators of my job huntin' experiences in this  town apply,
it'll be a total waste of my time
I guess I gotta do something though, I'm about to go bananas
If I had a damn job, we'd be rolling in it; but
I don't
we're not
ARGHHH!!!  Only a few more months to go before I can forget the stench of this hole called Augusta
Cheers
'you made my weekend, and just the thought of you makes me smile
'  someone said that to me
do you believe that no one has ever said that to me before?  regardless if anyone has ever felt that, no one has ever put it into words and said that to me
it felt so nice
so sweet and genuine
:)  yay
on an unrelated note
i'm sick!  i've gotten sick so much this year, i think it's from subbing and being around dirty kids all the time
not that i completely mind, becuse i love the kids, but i could really do without being sick all the time
wow!  that's great news john!
I am surprisingly busy right now
I did check the calendar and according to it I am on summer right now
How could I be busy in a time where I have no deadlines?  Wait I do!  I always put myself under pressure with deadlines
I think that is because I can only relax knowing that the relaxing needs to end soon and I need to get back to work
That '5 more minutes' feeling makes the time I am wasting seem like much less of a waste
I have a deadline with the Lethal Confinement DVD's that I set!  The end of next week, why?  Why did I set it then?  AM I CRAZY!?  Seriously, I have 10 weeks to relax yet I force myself to rush to get something done in the first two
Then there comes the times like new when I am rushing to get the job done by the weekend
First of all, I am on summer
Weekends are the same as weekdays only I have both parents home not working vs
on home working
Second of all, I HAVE ANOTHER WEEK!  The end of 9th grade was crazy, I was doing like 5 major projects and rushing because the day school got out was all of their deadlines
The first day of summer I had no priorities, no deadlines
I was totally bored!  This year I think I had the same number of deadlines by the end of school but they were all even more important!  So now I am totally swamped with 2 weeks left before school gets out
What do I do?  I relax
That was my theory, why rush?  If they don't get done, they don't get done!  As it turns out I completed all but one, the Lethal Confinement DVD
Please leave a comment on this topic, am I the only one who goes through this rush?  I hate doing DVD's
They are such a pain
Firs of all you need to make your materials
Once you have used up all the space on your hard drive editing the stupid video you sit for six hours and wait for it to encode
Now you have no space at all so you dust off the external hard drive from your last project and plug it in
Now you need to make menus
Open Photoshop and realize you have no idea how to work the layout
You figure that out and hopefully don't need video in the menu because then you need to go edit it
You start the Photo shop portion of the menu and realize you have no extra content and decide you need some
After pulling some out of your ass you ask yourself, why would someone watch this?  You put it on there anyway
Then you open the DVD program and author all the menus
This will take a day if you are lucky
You test it, build it and test it again
Finally you settle for what you have made and decide to burn it only to get an error and you have no idea what it says!  Video File Read Error was this projects error
I spent 7-8 days talking to people on the apple message boards looking for an answer, trying all different things
Finally I figure out that the main video file is corrupt
I NEED TO RE-EXPORT IT!  I DELETED A BUNF OF IT YESTERDAY!  So then you need to re-capture and re-export
yay!  DVD's suck!  Be thankful that people will sit there every day working $10 an hour to deal with this for you to click 'Play Movie' and never look at any other menu but the main one
Well today’s theme is relaxing
Go relax and get rid of those deadlines
If you constantly push yourself, not taking the brakes you are screwed!
Have you ever taken a step back and looked at your life and realized that things you worked and planned for just didn’t turn out like you thought they would?&nbsp; It’s a funny thing this life is
&nbsp; I’ve known this for a while, but I really only just learned this recently
&nbsp; I recently sat down and looked at the developments in my life these last few years and I see my life in a completely different place than I imagined it would be just a few years ago
&nbsp; Even plans I had even 3 months ago have been altered or just plan shit on
&nbsp; For instance, a long time ago, I thought I would be a chemical engineer and now I’m getting a job as a Financial Planner
&nbsp; Another example is what happened with my girlfriend of 3 years suddenly calling it quits and walking away from me; right when I was ready to commit myself to her 100%
&nbsp; Talk about a 180 degree swing
&nbsp;  Some might argue that there is only one lesson to be learned from situations like these
&nbsp; That lesson, they argue, is that we should not allow ourselves to become to attached to any given person or dream without complete confidence and assurance that they will prevail or succeed
&nbsp; In other words, should we allow ourselves to put all our eggs in one basket and risk being left with nothing when our plans, dreams, and passions turn to crap?&nbsp; Others feel differently
They would argue that if we believe in something so adamantly or want something badly enough, shouldn't we be willing to risk everything we hold sacred(Our self-respect, loved ones, sanity, careers, or anything else of worth) just to see that our plans and dreams come together as we initially planned?&nbsp; These are difficult questions to answer
&nbsp; Not because I do not want to broach the subject, but because each situation and each person would answer that in their own way
&nbsp;  In my particular situation, the steps I have taken in response to the wrinkle that has occurred in my life recently have been quite discouraging
&nbsp; What has happened to me in terms of my love life has taken a turn for the worse unexpectedly and I was left at a loss as I tried to remedy the situation
&nbsp; But there is one thing I have learned; when it comes to love, to make it work, you have to put yourself, your heart, and emotions into the hands of another
&nbsp; I agree with the later suggestion that you should be willing to risk it all for the sake of your happiness
You must leave yourself completely vulnerable to disappointment and heartbreak
&nbsp; This was a tough decision that I made a few months ago as I surrendered to dedicating myself to her completely
&nbsp; I was blind to the fact that, in just a few short months, it would all blow up in my face
&nbsp; Furthermore, I was ignorant to how I would respond to such rejection
&nbsp; With reckless abandon, I managed to turn a bad situation even worse
&nbsp; I fear I lost the one thing I wanted to hold onto
&nbsp; I decided I would lay it all out there and risk it all on the gamble of winning her heart again
I knew what I was risking, but I thought it all worth it
I laid it all on the line and did whatever I could to hold this relationship together
I showed determination, faithfullness, patience, love, kindness, and generosity mixed in with a little bit of emotional trama
But the moves I made were contrary to what she wanted and it only made her upset with me to the point where she hates me now
&nbsp; The shitty part is, I can’t even explain that to her because she won’t care
&nbsp; She has turned her heart into stone
&nbsp; We have reached the point-of-no-return and pissed all over it
She would rather rub it in that she is talking to, flirting with, and dating other guys
&nbsp; Ah, love… It’s a motherfucker
&nbsp; It does things to a man you would never expect
I've been thinking about the origin of drinking cow milk
Now, it is logical and biological that a baby drinks from her lactating mother's teat (I've wanted an occasion to say 'teat'), but how did the first human realize that cow milk was not only safe for human consumption, but also (arguably) tasty?  Now this is all  moo t, to me since I am lactose intolerant
:)  I have the same question about eggs
Again, who was that man (or woman) that made that initial decision to take an egg that come's out of a chicken's butt and make it a meal?  Speaking of chickens, that gets me to wondering how they reproduce
I did some research and this is what I found:  How do chickens reproduce?  Answer:  Chickens reproduce in a manner similar to some other animals
The female produces an egg which if fertilized can result in a baby chick
The true egg, the part that develops into the embryo, is located on the egg yolk
The yolk begins to develop in the ovary and after 10-12 days of development, ovulation occurs
If the female has been mating with a male, sperm will be present and fertilization can occur
The male chicken does not have a penis and therefore there is no penetration of the female reproductive tract at the time of mating
Instead the female inverts the cloaca (site of the common junction of the reproductive and digestive systems) which comes in contact with the maleÂs inverted cloaca and receives the sperm
The cloaca is then drawn back into the henÂs body and the sperm are captured
They then begin the journey up the length of the reproductive system
The sperm live inside the female reproductive system and each time an ovulation occurs (every 24-26 hours in good egg producers) the egg can become fertile
This process continues and matings at 7 - 10 day intervals are necessary to maintain fertility
After fertilization occurs the egg albumen, shell membranes, and shell are added to complete the egg formation process
The chicken usually lays the egg about 24 hours after ovulation
I read once in Collier's magazine that the top 3 signs of homosexuality are as follows:  1- Being attracted to members of the same sex, 2- Having more sex in a day than meals, 3- Posting messages on a Blog
So I guess I qualify for two out of three (and I am NOT attracted to members of the same sex
)  But we are all a little gay
Some people are just UBER-gay, like Licky Poo-Poo and your bruther Craaig
But holla' at the beer-funneling through the anus
I never thought it could be done, but you guys proved me wrong
I just downloaded the video
The quality is surprisingly good
Some people say that when it comes to Blogging, you've either got something to say or you don't
But if you've got something to say, why the fuck don't you just say it instead of writing it down on some gay-ass blog?  Fuck those people
Autumn-Leezy Blog forever!!!  We're here and we're queer, and if you can't get used to it

ok so ive only had one class so far, but already the drunkeness that is Unofficial St
Patricks Day has been revealed
this kid came to disc so drunk he could barely enter the room
he had one of the leprechaun hats on and a bunch of stickers on his face
i wonder if he knew he reeeked of beer - quite funny cuz my TA commented on it and he looked all surprised
anyway, he took the quiz, then left with a bellowing 'HAPPY SAINT PATTYS DAY!!'  then on my way to the lab, a crowd of kids dressed in green came stauntering down the quad and one yelled 'ITS UNOFFICIAL ST
PATRICKS DAY!!  IF YOURE NOT DRUNK,  GET  DRUNK!!'  the visiting kids and their parents probly didnt appreciate that so much (yeah today is some all college visit thing day as well as engineering open house - way to be smart u of i - next yr u might not want to schedule events where there are tons of visitors on campus the same day that tons of kids will be drunk off their asses and wandering the streets)  so far today has been on the amusing side
ran into amy, courtny, paul, and lisa so far and everyone is in good spirits
it might be the weather, yes, it might be cuz green beer is good, but it also might be the fact that everyone i kno is either getting drunk or going to get drunk b4 the sun goes down
ahh how im going to miss u of i traditions =)

Korea Halts Work at Nuclear Facility - U
Officials (washingtonpost
com)   The North Korean situation continues to simmer, and while there isn't a lot of public action going on, I believe there is plenty happening behind the scenes
Kim Jong-Il craves attention, and the less public attention he gets, the more agitated he becomes
It is best we handle this quietly and with a minimum of public fuss
I still think this ends in one of two ways
) China yanks his chain and he wises up
) He exercises the only option he has left to avoid looking like a complete fool - he tests a nuke
At that moment, the next war begins, and I see no other way to assure the safety of that part of the world other than immediate nuclear strikes on North Korean weapons facilities, as well as conventional decapitation strikes on the North Korean leadership
If anyone wants to kick around my NK thinking, let me know and I'll expand my thoughts
i spent around $100 today
but i did really well
i got a lot for my money
&nbsp;   tonight, i am relaxing
watching spiderman with isabel, and hopefully when keith gets home from work he'll call
or sooner
that would do too
&nbsp;   i think about him a lot
it's kind of frightening
and the more i think about it, the more right it seems
i'm just terrified that he doesn't feel the same way
i know he likes me, but how much? i wish i knew
but i guess time will tell
i have a feeling that the next time we're together in person, it'll say a lot
i want him to know i like him
but subtly, and
ok, i'm babbling now
&nbsp;   so
alissa got her license
those of us who read her journal are never going to hear the end of how great she thinks she is
&nbsp;   driver's ed tomorrow
She asked me to be a 'guest' writer, though I would have prefered to be a 'ghost' writer
&nbsp; Then I suppose I would also have to give credit to someone else and I chose to be no other than the Cherry Bomber
&nbsp; Miss JanAss is unable to easily access a computer as to post an update of her life (or she's too fuckin lazy and is making me do it
) so she's making me do it
&nbsp; And since I don't know what the hell she's doing because i'm a 13 hour car ride away, I'll consider her longingly
After months of transition and breaking the protective notion of a relationship, tenative decisions and many advice seeking e-mails, six weeks of debauchery and drunken ruin, she has decided to remain living in Montreal for her health and her sex life
&nbsp; And I was convinced by the end of my french course, not wanting to leave the endless cruising around town on bicycles and drinking in parks, rock shows and strange parties, that I should decide the same fate for myself, if for no better reason (though there are many) than to learn french
No one doubles you on her bicycle seat while drunk&nbsp;on draught better than her
&nbsp; To feel secure balance on a seat stuck up your crotch, teetering side to side brushing traffic and worming through parked and moving cars (Montreal drivers at that) at 4am lets you know who your friends are
&nbsp; If there is only one pillow on the bed, she'll give it to you
&nbsp; If you have only one beer in the fridge, and your not around, she'll likely drink it, especially if it is a Guiness
&nbsp; I was still drunk on one hour sleep when I frantically packed up my bag to catch my ride back home and forgot to say goodbye
&nbsp; But she found the photo of myself&nbsp;I tacked on her wall beside her mirror when she woke up and felt that was just as well, despite the fact I randomly put it there a couple days before hand and she just hadn't noticed
&nbsp;  I think i'd do better as a ghost writer
&nbsp; Perhaps i'll grow my armpit hair
&nbsp; Is arm pit one word or two?
Let's  urlLink lighten up  a bit

I was going to go on a rant on how addicting the internet is, but I didn't have the energy to do it
It did remind me of one of the reasons why it's addicting:  urlLink mindless dribble that yet somehow manage to entertain
SONG OF THE DAY  Prince - I Could Never Take The Place Of Your Man
I've always been a fan of his writing, and  urlLink here is an interview  about his latest book
Definitely worth reading if you like P
Okay, so
I guess I last spoke about Monday morning
I'm pretty sure I didn't do anything that night
Tuesday it was only 9 AM tennis, followed by lunch with the band kids once again
Tuesday was Sal's day
Alex got into Chrissie's car through the sun roof, and put a gross fork he stole from the restaurant in my hair
Then I came home, had some serious confusion over working, and after finding out I didn't have to after clearing my schedule, I went to see Chrissie anyway
About 45 minutes into the deal Alyssa found out her grandparents sent her money and so she really didn't need to be working
So she bailed out and left me and Chrissie to work
Then the Thigpens came to visit! Matt drove himself and Alex over and they visited for a while
Honestly
Those Thigpens
They just end up behind the counter without my knowing or realizing
I mean Matt I expected it from
He's done it plenty times before
But at one point Chrissie and I were in the back with Matt showing him around and as we come out we see Alex sitting on the back counter flipping through a catalog
?  Then around closing time I was reconciling my drawers and the other Alex showed up all gross from wrestling
His shirt was really really dirty
So all in all Chrissie and I had a really snazzy time
I like that kid
Wednesday morning was 8-12 tennis again
Stacy ran up to meet me after my practice from hell
You see tennis is just one of those sports where it requires so much focus to get your strokes and everything coordinated, that if one thing is off, you screwed
I had one of those days
Needless to say I wasn't feeling so toasty inside
So Stace patiently waited for me to regain my composure and fight back my tears, and we headed up to the curb to wait for the band kids to finish
Chrissie gave us a ride to Quizno's, and I sat on the curb with everyone while they ate their sandwiches
toasty
Well save Moira and her awesome cooler
She graciously let me partake in some much needed Welch's fruitsnacks
So before long we headed back and my sister picked me up
We went to Staples for school supplies!  We got many a school supply and Kel got a new wireless printer and mouse
After that we headed to Michael's for some stuff
I got new drawing pencils, a kneaded eraser, and tortillons
My sister got
fun crafty stuff
We realized for her projects we could stand some paint, and I instantly thought of my dear Jess G
So we stopped by her home, and met her fantastic new kitten! He's awesome
And I mean awesome
All kittens are awesome
So about 45 minutes and no paint later we headed home
Unfortunately the day's wear and tear had gotten to me and I couldn't muster the strength to go to the Roe's pool party with   urlLink  Stace    and Amanda
I chilled at the homestead
Thursday started out like any other day, tennis at 8 AM
But then, it began to rain around 10:30, and practice got cancelled
So I made a Rite Aid run with Kel, came back to the school to see some friends, and got to experience the scheduling snafoo with Chrissie, Alex, and Chris
We deducted that they don't like to deal with Chrissie
Every time she walks into the office, they all turn and pretend to be busy
Oh man that was a good time
Anyway around 1:00 I call my mom to let her know where I am
I mention the scheduling conflicts, and she says, 'Oh, yeah, you got a letter yesterday saying yours is messed up
' Thanks Mom
So I join my cohorts in line and end up sitting with Danny and Mrs
Houlihan waiting for Mrs
Karas for about a half hour
She sees me right away, bless her heart, and we deduce that I should talk to my art teacher to see if I can do more of an independent study with Art Major II
So on my way out of the school, I see Mrs
Lister in the lobby! Hoorah! Mrs
Lister is a fabulous art teacher and was my homeroom teacher last year
I learn she will be my teacher next year, and I tell her about my problem
She says that would be fine because I will be 'a good addition to the art program
' So at fifteen hundred hours, my schedule was set
Word up
I went home, got ready for work, and got to see my dear Stacy and my dear Chrissie
Soon enough plans are made, I escape the hell that was work, and I accompany my sister to Kohl's for picture frames
I got this really awesome photo album that has a picture of a teddy bear on the front and says 'Beary Special Moments
' Anyone who's got beef, *coughchrisbowyercough*, better get with the times cause your face will be in it!!!  And onward to Danny's
I arrived late to a viewing of THE RING (dn dnn dnnnnnn)
This was held for those who had not had the pleasure before, including Chrissie and Jenna
hahaha
Hope they weren't as disturbed as I was a few hours after I first saw it
Anyway I got yelled at for talking too much and laughing at scary parts
But luckily I had Danny who also saw the humor in that woman falling down the well
At the end he selected the scene again and we got to watch her fall in slow motion
Fantastic
I think everyone finally realized the glory of it
On to fabulous Friday! As I stepped out onto my porch I realized the heat that would be today
We baked out on the courts, but it was a great day of practice
Allison and I got our Alley Rally and Cross Court drills, and at the end we got to play games
I was the only one left on my team in a game of Around The World with one raquet, and unfortunately I didn't posess the reaction time today that is required in that game
But oh well
Then I caught a ride with everyone over to Hoss's! There we watched Bowyer get 3 helpings of ice cream, Moira taught us there's an bottle of extra icing for the raisin bread, and we met a 70 year-old version of Matt Thigpen
We also learned what those light fixtures are  really  for
I really admire everyone in band for their sunglasses
Matt Thigpen looks like he's ready to drive fast, Jimmy looks ready to rock, and Neil looks like an 80 year-old tourist
Those band kids are my favorites
So that's all for now
I have serious decisions to make regarding this year's courses, and serious summer homework to do
Until later
Hey all!!   So VBS finished yesterday without a hitch
all went as well as can be expected
&nbsp; I understand your pain Lisa (she went through VBS this past week also)
&nbsp; I think I like the little kids though better than 4/5 graders
&nbsp; Although I don't mind shepherding for them and hey, I will take what Sonia gives me!&nbsp; Sonia asked me last night about my schedule for the fall and it looks like I will be continuing with the 3rd Sunday- teaching 2/3 yr olds and the first Wed
of every month babysitting for 2 hours
&nbsp; All in all it is really fun
they grow up so fast
&nbsp; The 200 kids raised over 1400 bucks for a missionary in Hungry
&nbsp; Amazing how much they have in there little piggy banks
&nbsp; Steve told them to say this when they got hungry, 'Mom, I'm hungry, I need some money to take to VBS for Hungry
'&nbsp; When each color got to there goal, 125 bucks, they got a 100 grand candy bar
&nbsp;  It is amazing though how many parents don't even remember you
&nbsp; I had a parent come up to me the other day (I babysit her kids on Wednesday nights and it just so happens that she also is a helper with the college class) and say, 'Hi, I don't think we have met
'&nbsp; I said actually we have
I babysit your child every so often on Wed
nights
needless to say she was shocked that she never recognized me and now on Wed
she always says hi
&nbsp;&nbsp;   I found out that we ranked 5th in soccer (out of 9 I think) and 12/13 in softball
&nbsp;   Now that all the sports has ended we don't have anything to practice for on Sundays
&nbsp; We are going to continue having some sort of sport during our practice time
&nbsp; I know I have, and a bunch others, really look forward to playing some sort of sport then
&nbsp;   Ok, I think that is all
I will write again to update you all on the weekend!
My lease is up at the end of June, but I figured that with only one year of Law School left, why not just stay? You can't beat the rent, especially since I don't have to live in the sketchy areas of North Park or University Heights to get it
Why is it, anyway, that anytime a place has the name 'Heights' it turns out to be a scary bars-on-the-window sort of neighborhood? Remember that TV show 'The Heights'?  Anywho, I'm staying on good ol' Reynard for now, paying good ol' sub-$700 rent and putting up with my good OLD neighbors
The median age among my building's 7 apartments was 53 before I moved in
Summer classes start on Monday, and I'm mildly nervous/excited
It's like the normal nervous/excited status, only cut by summer's lazy attitude
I'll end up waking god-awful early 3 days a week, I get one day off (Tuesday, randomly) and I'm never in class past 12:30
Should be a good summer!  Right now I'm in the computer lab (waiting for Hilary and, with her, lunch) and they've gone and purchased all new, flatscreen monitors for every (also new) computer
I'm at once both impressed and annoyed; perhaps the money would be better spent on new copiers that don't break every 2 hours, or more copies of books that are always missing/checked out
Then again, maybe it was a specific grant for 'technology infrastructure improvement' or some other stupid thing
All I'm saying is, I hate those copiers, man
Here is a pretty cool blog that I found if you want to take a look:   urlLink http://mikao

if onli we could do tt more often instead of clubbin'
Hope Kenneth reads this
bWahahahaX!   Ken, Guoliang & Jolene 'invited' mi out for a b'day supper on the day itself
Waoh!! tt was the 2nd time I went to chomp chomp and I was realli surprised by how much it's changed since the last time I came 5 yrs back!! The food was yummy too!! Had sum bbq chix wingz, stingray, fried Hokkien mee and cockles
realli thankful to Ken & Guoliang for initiatin' this outin'
Told them to postpone the meetin' till Xikai they all r free, but i suppose they were too eager to see mi
HahahaX!! Anyway, thanx dudes!! For spendin' the remainin' hours of my b'day wif mi!!!~! Frenz forever!!  Speakin' of frenz
I may haf rcv quite a few b'day wishin' but the person whom I wanted his wishin' so badly did not convey his wishin'
*HaiX* Not blamin' him
but juz damned disappointed
11 yrs of friendship
*SiGhZ*    Being 24 and still being financialli dependent is a fact I find it hard to accept
All these yrs of education, is it realli neccessary
I'm sure moz of u muz haf peers who haf not even completed their dilploma or degree but are currently earnin' big bucks
In constrast, I haf frenz who graduated a few yrs back but are sloggin' everyday juz to make ends meet
While society places a high emphasis on education, we should oso question the value of certification
Does it propel us further?? Faster??   There is onli this much a degree can do for us
Mabbe sum of us are comfortable wif a startin' pay of $1
8K as long as the prospect of the job is good
I'm definitely fine wif the amt
It's juz tt how do u define 'prospect'? Earnin' $5k or even $8k per month 10 yrs down the road
Endin' up in a managerial level and receivin' peanut pay?? How would anyone be satisfied wif such so-called 'acheivements'
n may I remind u tt we r in Singapore!!! Face it!! tt's the cruel truth!! Juz a reminder to those degree holders out there including myself tt hafin a paper certification can onli show tt we can study
It doesn't reflect our level of success in future!! So dun be too full of urself esp those 'Honours' students!! Hee!!! It's no big deal!!!   'Many of life's failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up
'Sure,' the woman asked, 'Why Not?'  Why Not! Why not indeed
&nbsp; It was all I could do not to laugh
&nbsp; Well, that's a lie
&nbsp; I'm virtually incapable of laughter or expressing any emotion when I'm wearing the suit
&nbsp; Years as a recruitment officer does that to you
&nbsp; If any of them could see me at home, with Fluffy, they'd never believe it was me
Anyway, we gave her the papers, the time and place, and got back in the car (black of course)
'Where to next?' I asked my partner, Steve or Sven or Marcus or whoever was with me that day
(One of the guys for sure, but on the job we all act alike
)  'Guy named Ian Wallace, should be at the mall
'  'Great
&nbsp; Maybe we'll have time to go shopping
'  He didn't answer
&nbsp; I think it was Marcus
&nbsp; Guy has no sense of humor
&nbsp; I mean, none of us are supposed to, but I've never even seen Marcus laugh off duty
&nbsp; We drove on silently for a while, but I hate long conversationless pauses
&nbsp; This never was my dream job
&nbsp; I'm not cutout for this work
&nbsp; But then, none of us are
&nbsp; The Recruiters are the leftovers
&nbsp; The people who really did have nothing to lose
&nbsp; Most people; finish their mission, have some epiphany and they know what they want to do with their life
&nbsp; We're the ones who finished our mission and still couldn't find anything else
&nbsp; Except Marcus
&nbsp; I really think Marcus likes it
Anyhow, I said to Marcus, to break the silence,  'What's with all the black anyway? Why do we have to look like we just walked out of the Matrix to be recruiters?'  'You know why,' he replied boredly, 'We can't standout in any way
&nbsp; The recruitee's decision must be based on their own desperate situation, not on impressions of us
We must-'  'Be totally emotionaless, personalitiless, and uninteresting,' I finished for him, 'I know the creed, but I still think we could be uninteresting in something more comfortable
'  He didn't answer again
&nbsp; It was definitely Marcus
&nbsp; What a piece of work
'Don't compromise yourself
You are all you've got

hollow1 Look out for the       m   HOLE      Username:     From  urlLink Go-Quiz
com   Hmm
*shrugs* I guess you better watch out
Prepare yourselves for the most boring blog ever blogged
12:02: I wake up
12:05: Eat breakfast (dry waffles) 12:07- 12:35: Surf Internet, comment on Derby's blog 12:35-12:43: I wander aimlessly, still not woke up 12:45-12:55: Read  The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay
I realize that it is Father's Day tomorrow, and I am going to have to go outside today
I head for the shower
1:23: Finish showering, brushing teeth, and putting clean clothes on
1:31: Feed Lilly, leave house 1:38: Arrive downtown at  Antiques and Accents  1:43: Leave  Antiques and Accents  with my Father's Day present, a sort of metal cabinet thing with places to put junk
1:43-2:01: I drive around, with no particular plan, hoping I will run into someone I know but not really in the mood to do anything
I then return home
2:03: make Macaroni and Cheese, eat it 2:25: clean out and wash off metal cabinet, take back strut holder things off and throw them away, because they suck and detract from the aestheic quality the cabinet has 2:28-3:42: Read  Kavalier and Clay  3:42-4:40: I leave my house and head over to my mother's house for some food and stimulating conversation
My mom unsuccessfully tries to get me to attend church with her and Sam
I think about teaching Sam what I believe but decide that a few years with the Protestants will do him good
Suffering builds character, and Goats need all the character that they can get
4:41-4:50: Drive home, singing because my tape deck is broken
5:00-5:25: read some more  Kavalier  5:27-5:50: make yet another trip into town to water my grandma's tomato plant
I drink some hose water and it makes me feel sick
6:05-6:38: play  Worms  6:40-8:50: Since there is nothing else to do, I get down with some serious jams on my acoustic guitar
I add  Should I Stay or Should I Go, Say Anything , and  You  to my repertoire
I also wrote songs named  One Chord Song, Two Chord Song, Three Chord Song, John is a Sellout, Techno Sucks, Go Drive Off a Bridge, If you listen to Blink-182 you must be a 13 year old girl, Country Sucks, A homeless man kicked me in the crotch (twice), I hope you get ran over by a Ford Thunderbird, Star Trek Sucks  and  I fought Adam Pelkey to the death
Finally, I finished my crowning achievement,  A boy and his Jetpack
Part rock opera, part emo song, part spoken word, it is bound to elicit strange new emotions in you
8:52-9:07: more  Kavalier
9:07-9:34: more jamming  9:36-10:40 drink hot chocolate and have serious discussion on the nature of art with Lilly
Also, I have the most brilliant thought I have ever thought on a entirely unrelated subject
10:40-11:42 yet more  Kavalier
11:44-11:58: shower, brush teeth 12:03-12:32: Read Sunday's  Dispatch  In all honesty, I have a few hours of activity left but I am sick of writing things down
I have checked out Bowling for Liars before, and I know some of the claims to be untrue
Actually, I saw a whole thing about Michael Moore and websites like those on Free Speech TV
(9415 on Satellite) Anyway, I know that Michael Moore exaggerates, unfairly edits, makes claims to get attention
But that doesn't mean that he isn't right most of the time
Besides, it is nothing compared to the repeated lies by some conservatives (Ann Coulter, FOX News)
The Al Franken website springs out of the neo-con's hatred of Al
Me and John don't have to work until Tuesday, actually
I felt the same way about Harry Potter, except for the blasphemous hand-touching of Ron and Hermoine
I almost walked out when I saw this, walked out and puked my guts out
Obviously  Ron and Hermoine are just friends
Hermoine's got that Ruskie, and Ron gets a crush on that French girl if I remember my Potterology correctly
Ah, the mall
Why do I hate the mall? First of all, everything there is overpriced
Second of all, the people who hang out there suck
But most importantly is because of stores like Hot Topic
Back in my day (last summer), you got into punk through  music , not clothing
Now I wouldn't say that I dress outrageously
In fact I would say that I dress quite moderately
Yes, our clothing reflects our punkness, but we aren't punk because of how we dress
It is just us following our tradition and emulating our idols, as many types of people do
But now you have Good Charlotte or Nofx fans walking into a Hot Topic, buying some studded bracelets and some T-shirts, and calling themselves 'punks
' I abhor this
I hate how corporations exploit whatever is 'cool' at the moment, taking everything we love and trying to peddle it to other people by suggesting that they will be more popular and credible if they wear their gear
In fact every type of person whose scene has been exploited by Hot Topic hates it
In my English class, I had a bunch of girls who would be called 'goths' by people who knew less
To them, it was just the way they were
They hated a bunch of fake attention whores telling them, 'Yeah, I got this at Hot Topic! I feel real sinister and stuff now!' This brings me back to my disdain for the psuedos
They get some Rancid, Casualties, and Mxpx shirts and feel like real rebels when in truth they haven't taken the time to find out what they are getting into, what the philosophy and the meaning behind the word 'punk' is
I know everyone has got to start somewhere, but I didn't get into punk through wearing Nofx t-shirts, the Oselands didn't get into punk through having mohawks, Alex didn't get into punk by wearing zipper pants
We are punks because we believed those ideas before we found punk rock, we just didn't have a name for it
You can learn about punk while still keeping your self-respect and dignity
I don't want to be told what is cool by MTV
I don't want to be my scene to be torn into easily-digestible pieces and sold in malls to unassuming kids
I don't want for the hockey players in my school to set a precendent for all the other kids to follow
I don't want to use the word 'doneski' when I speak
I don't want to pass up life and experience and instead be taught by corporations how to think
I don't want to hear JT's new single
I don't want to eat at McDonalds
I don't want to learn punk from some kid at my school who thinks that he is rebelling because heard Good Charlotte sing, 'I don't wanna be you
' I don't want to be a part of a clique
I don't want to be assumed anti-social just because I find most of the people at my school vapid and boring
I want to decide for myself
So, the writing thing I went to last night was
interesting
I guess it just wasn't what I was expecting
I thought it would be filled with people in their 20's, who all write like David Sedaris, and make witty, intellectual comments about each others work
Not true
it was indeed 5 people- myself, Joe, a high school english teacher, and two old women
Needless to say, I was skeptical
Or maybe that's not needless to say, maybe I'm just prejudice against the elderly
I decided to read a little of my 'work'
meaning, random thoughts written down with no point, no direction- much like my blogs
I just wanted to get an opinion of what I could do with my writing
The HS teacher suggested I write an advice column and just use the questions as a format to go off on my own random tangents
Nice, but I don't think I could really even give the initial advice
He also said that I'm very self-involved
If I wanted to lie, I would say I was shocked, but he pretty much hit the nail on the head
I am, but I think that's completely typical for people at this stage in our lives
Or I'm just making an excuse for my self-indulgent behavior
Old woman to my left asked what I wanted to do with my life, to which I responded, 'I'm undeclared'
Undeclared- it's freshman year all over again
I feel lame admitting this, and I don't know why, but when I spoke at this alumni seminar, I had everyone laughing with my random (apparantly, everything is random about me) stories and quirky anecdotes and amusing mannerisms- and afterwards everyone telling me how funny I was
And I loved the high I got from this- maybe it's the attention, maybe it's that boost of self-esteem I constantly crave, whatever it is, I just want to have that feeling for the rest of my life
I just need to figure out how

regret doing conditioning yesterday night
i slept ard 3am and just woke up
physically tired and have little time to spare
need to get my poa homework and project done with
gt math test tmr also
5 hrs left
i will make it insyaAllah! :) be back later
i went to a 'recently' edited blog called simply mama
this mama didn't sound mean- just bored to tears watching madtv and conan when she cannot sleep
i hope that i sound more mean than boring
Went to see this on Thursday with H
Beautiful, beautiful film
Parts of it are like watching sunshine
It is a very gentle and tender examination of family, love and trust
What I found most interesting was the way food was treated
Several times in the film meals appeared almost as sacrament
Allowing people access to family life and rebuilding relationships, I liked that
urlLink Go see
Time to blog - why - why not - it seems to be the done thing of course!
ok, so i borrowed spanish tapes from the library, and already i cannot remember words past adios and ola
i will have to get really good at pointing and nodding
i have decided on 2 hotels- one in barcelona and 1 in madrid- both about $30 pp
for bilbao, i have been searching internet sites that list hotels- these hotels seem muchmore expensive- because only expensive hotels list on line
i will keep looking
i am pleased that several well-regarded travelers are considering this spanish adventure
Well I should of gone into school today to hand in coursework
But considering I haven't finished it I thought I better not
I will finish it today and hand it in tomorrow
She can't get that angry at me because I know some people arn't handing it in until tomorrow anyway
I have got to babysit tonight which means an extra 5 to spend, Although I just remebered I owe Nicki 2 or 3
As she brought me a train ticket and I never paid her the full ammount back
I had a huge fright this morning because my mum phoned from work saying are you sure you haven't got school
Now I was thinking that the teacher I was seeing today had phoned up, but in fact all it was, was that when my mum drove to work she saw all of the cars in the school car park
Forrtuantly I told her all the teachers had to go in, so the scare was avoided
To david- I wonder whether you put on any weight? And also what did you spend your winnings on? I hope it was something for me
Wow, I can't beleive I am making such huge posts recently! Maybe it's because I am putting off doing work if I type long things?
Kurt Vonnegut has a quote that goes something like this  'Every person, living and dead, is purely coincidental'  If that be true, than is the world not a little more chaotic than we ever knew
Yet, we have social classes, organized government, elected leaders, and standards
like organized chaos
Maybe I'm interpretting the quote differently than he meant it
What are your thoughts?   Also, have you ever looked  a slab of meat and thought it was rather disgusting? because that's what i generally think when i look at it
Not that i'm a animal right's activist or that i'm imagining a dead animal on my plate, but the first time i looked at raw meat
it really ruined eating for me
at least for awhile
you know what i really hate lately? everything
no really
i hate people
maybe im expecting too much from them
maybe im just oversensitive, but sometimes it seems like im the only one of my friends who cares about, well, being a good friend
i think that there are certain unwritten rules to friendship, things like you dont steal your best friend's boyfriend or eat their mcdonalds salad while theyre in the bathroom, etc
and you would expect that you would be able to trust your friends, maybe not all of them, but at least your closest ones
stuff like that
is it too much to expect certain things out of friendship? im beginning to think so
maybe im the only person who thinks its important to be sensitive to the stuff thats going on in their lives, how theyre feeling and the things that they might need from a friend at the moment, whether its a pint of ben and jerry's or a long talk or a good smack in the face
and there should be a little give and take in the relationship
you listen to them constantly complain about their boyfriend,and in turn they listen to you whine about your failing math grade
sometimes you may get sick of hearing about loverboy, and they may get sick of hearing about the test you bombed,  but you both listen because thats what friends are for - theyre youre support group, your guidance counselors, and your advice encyclopedias
lately i feel though that some friendships i have are rather onesided
im the shoulder-to-cry-on/gossip buddy/mall companion when its convienent
and theyre there for me too
but only sometimes
they dont always notice when things are bothering me because they can only care when they have a free moment from their own lives
im by no means saying that i dont do the same thing, because im sure that there have been many times when i was too wrapped up in whatever was going on in my own life to notice
but i do know that i make a conscious effort NOT to do that
the truth is that i have very few friends who do the same
if i ever do that i wish that one of my friends would be like, hey, whoa, you need to stop with the Me-fest and pay attention to what im going through here
maybe thats what  i  need to do right now
i do realize that most people arent mindreaders
i would do almost anything for someone i care about
but i just get the feeling that im everyones afterthought
im not trying to make myself out to be a martyr
i dont think there should be rewards when ever someone does some thats 'good friend'-y
there are lots of sacrifices and compromises in friendship
but i dont think that its asking too much to expect people to pull their weight in a relationship
any relationship - boyfriend, girlfriend, sister, father, employer
and quite frankly, im tired of being someones 'best buddy' when were alone, and when their are other people around its a different story
i also dont mean to give the impression that this is a rant about one person in particular, because its not
but i certainly do hope that the people in question figure out that im talking about them, because unless things change, i dont forsee these friendships lasting much longer
perhaps im at fault
maybe its something that im doing that makes them not want to reciprocate, i dont know
i think that the main issue is that there needs to be some communication
ive been so intent on removing myself from being involved in any type of drama this year, and any kind of fights, that ive been afraid to confront things that arent just petty high school crap
or maybe they are
but its time to deal with whatever you want to call it
the post your looking for ben is below the two weird ones its really long and im terrified about you reading it
The Aids conference currently under way in Bangkok, Thailand has once again turned into a forum for the world to criticize the United States
Despite the fact that the US has spent twice as much as other donor nations combined (we have pledged $15 billion), world leaders, actors like Richard Gere and United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan have stepped up the criticism
They are accusing the United States of ignoring the plight of Aids victims while focusing too much attention on the war on terrorism
Addressing the conference, Richard Gere said “There is a vicious terrorist out there and it’s not Osama bin Laden, it’s Aids
”  He went on to say that Aids is the most fundamental threat to our happiness and livelihood
His comments are so absurd that they need no further elaboration
Kofi Annan, in a veiled criticism of the United States implied that our enthusiasm in fighting the war against terrorism is disproportionate to our desire to fight Aids and suggested we could do more
Convinced that the United States’ policy is driven by “neo-conservative” ideologues, few at the conference seem willing to even consider the effectiveness of an abstinence program
urlLink    Protesters in Thailand Demonstrate Against Bush&nbsp; urlLink     The policy of President Bush has been to promote abstinence programs throughout the world, rather than relying solely on “safe-sex” and condoms
Interestingly enough, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has supported the Bush policy, and as a result has become a target of criticism
His country is a rare example of a success story in Africa, a continent ravaged by Aids
By enforcing abstinence programs, his country has seen a drop in Aids infections
Those supporting condoms as the only way to prevent Aids seem to think that abstinence is cruel and unusual punishment
Asking people to wait until marriage before having sex is unrealistic, according to the critics of the Bush policy
This reaction ought not be surprising
In our sex-absorbed culture, it seems inconceivable for some to even contemplate abstinence
But the question must be asked; what is really going to solve the Aids problem?  The only way to ensure that Aids will not be transmitted is by not having sex and not taking drugs
It seems so obvious, so why all the confusion?  As usual, the Left has a quick fix for a serious, deep seeded moral problem that they refuse to recognize
Their message is the equivalent of saying; “play with this loaded gun, just be safe”
Refusing to address the root cause of the Aids epidemic, they look for simplistic solutions to a moral crisis
Since their understanding of sex is not rooted within any moral context of procreation, love, family and responsibility, they cannot be expected to see the moral roots of the Aids crisis
Abstinence programs, on the contrary, encourage a responsible and humane understanding of sex; that is, sex within the context of the married life is the only authentic purpose for human sexuality
Abstinence attacks the root of the problem, addressing the moral implications of sexuality
The source of the anger toward the president results from President Bush's refusal to use the bully pulpit as a spring board for the homosexual agenda
While Bush certainly wants to find a cure for Aids, he will not use his office as a propaganda machine for the homosexual movement in this country
I’m afraid that the criticism of the United States in Thailand is yet another example of the “blame America first” movement and has more to do with ideology that with fact
I have an incredible urdge to go somewhere
I really want to leave Lakewood for at least a day
Roadtrip!  I'm sick of this place and these people and my stupid problems
I need and escape
Hannibal, MO and Indy - Spoke at a teacher inservice today and had a ton of fun

urlLink      © 2004 Arielinds Photo      A bittersweet poem based on a couple stories we should all know
I drink milk and honey in my coffee; it’s my taste of the promised land
Keeps my bleary eyes open to see–- maybe there are  still  springs in the sand
So the cream and gold amid the black keep my eyes open to behold a pillar of flame, iridescent cloud at my back and a watered garden from a mountain peak
before I get too old
Still there are answers my imbibed alacrity can’t find–- Does my pathway end at this scenic mountain wall? Or does it crest the proffered overlook and fall? Will I ever enter Canaan…before I lose my body, soul and mind?
urlLink these people  have captured and enslaved my sanity
it is quite sad actually
they have very catchy and crazy songs, which are running around and chasing each other in my head
for days
*cries*  *beats the singing voices in her head up*   *silence resounds*  *anne rejoices*  *a small voice is heard singing  ''im your only friend, im not your only friend, but im a little glowing friend
' , shortly followed by another voice singing  'they call me doctor worm
good morning how are you, im doctor worm
im interested in things, im not a real doctor, but i am a real worm, i am an actual worm, i live like a worm and i like to play the drums
' *  *anne self-destructs*  on the topic of annoying songs
anyone remember this one?   1-2-3-4-5 senses working overtime, trying to tell the difference between a lemon and a lime, pain and pleasure and the church bells softly chime
(Senses Working Overtime-XTC (if you havent heard it, DON'T LISTEN!!! i heard it ONCE in grade 8, and its STILL there in my head
)  *runs away from the onslaught of enraged people who are now singing that song*  i'm sorry, i really am
but these songs wont leave me alone
and then i have finnish pop songs and mediaeval songs too
*cries* they dont go away
the soundtrack to my life could benefit from a mute button

HAHAHA, let's all thank Ddee for this
interesting email:   In Japan, they have replaced the impersonal and unhelpful Microsoft Error messages with Haiku poetry messages
Haiku poetry has strict construction rules
Each poem has only three lines, 17 syllables: five syllables in the first line, seven in the second, five in the third
Haikus are used to communicate a timeless message often achieving a wistful, yearning and powerful insight through extreme brevity  the essence of Zen:   Your file was so big
It might be very useful
But now it is gone
The Web site you seek  Cannot be located, but  Countless more exist
Chaos reigns within
Reflect, repent, and reboot
Order shall return
Program aborting:  Close all that you have worked on
You ask far too much
Windows NT crashed
I am the Blue Screen of Death
No one hears your screams
Yesterday it worked
Today it is not working
Windows is like that
First snow, then silence
This thousand-dollar screen dies  So beautifully
With searching comes loss  And the presence of absence:  'My Novel' not found
The Tao that is seen  Is not the true Tao-until  You bring fresh toner
Stay the patient course
Of little worth is your ire
The network is down
A crash reduces  Your expensive computer  To a simple stone
Three things are certain:  Death, taxes and lost data
Guess which has occurred
You step in the stream,  But the water has moved on

I love this weather!  The past 2 days have been a little warm, but I'm loving the 50-60ish days!  Also, I noticed today on my way to Saginaw, the colors of the leaves are changing!  It can even make US10 look nice!
Evil   Some of you might be wondering's what's the latest with my nephew, Jason
You know, the emotionally-scarred-by-parents, unhealthy-relationship-with-food, emotionally-withdrawn kid
Well, my sister reports that Jason was caught hitting another kid in daycare because the other kid tried to take his sippy cup
Jason's favorite word is 'NO!', which he uses in almost all contexts, but maybe that's because he only knows two words (the other is 'Daddy')
The kid hasn't learned how to say 'Mommy' yet, which I think is hilarious
To begin with, thanks to  urlLink goliard  and  urlLink David  for the responses
I may update sometime, but for now we'll just say progress is being made, and I think it's going to end up okay with Jules
Jules just spent five days at the beach with my family and I, and I am tan as two short tan things
We spoke vaguely, without me having to directly confront her, but I think for now all I can do is listen, because she seems to know that it needs to stop, and I'm probably the only friend who wasn't thrown into a complete shaking panic by it
This may be because I know her well, or because I'm in denial, but I still refuse to shove 'help' down her throat, for now
As long as she keeps talking to me instead of cutting, we can both pretend I don't know what's happened
So, despite something that most definitely could have screwed up a vacation, the beach was fantabulous
We had some interesting encounters there, beginning on the day we arrived, Saturday
The place we stay is a condominium thingy, which is basically shaped like an L with a pool in the crook, facing the ocean
So we'd be swimming and see these guy watching us from the balcony
If they weren't old, it was nothing to be alarmed about, and if they were cute, it was quite the ego boost
There were three in particular that were together that kept catching our eyes and waving to us
Two of them appeared to be identical twins, somewhat fair, and then their friend was really really tan
We called him the Dark One
Doesn't it sound nerdy?   Anyway, after two days of waving and smiling and saying 'hi' to these people when we passed them, Jules was ready to 'take the relationship to the next level,' as they say, and actually met them
She has a boyfriend, but harmless flirting means nothing to them
However, she doesn't exactly know that B and i have something of an understanding
[This one is of the 'I love you, but my parents will castrate you if they find out we're dating again' variety, so essentially everyone is wondering why I don't hit on people any more
] So rather than reveal to her information which could cause my dear B bodily harm, I sucked it up and initiated a conversation
I think it was something like, 'Uh, we can't decide if you're identical or fraternal, uh, hi?' and then we spoke for a while
It was pretty nice, I guess, even though their 'I can't run good''s made me clench my teeth
So these three guys (aged sixteen
Jules and I are cradle-robbers, we are) had this other little kid running around witht hem that they had just met on vacation
He was short and looked like he was, oh, thirteen, but he claimed he was sixteen
(Hint - he's from Georgia and claims he failed his driver's test
of course, he doesn't seem to remember that whole learner's permit law we have
But yeah, he was sixteen like i was looking to date those guys
)   The kid was odd
He was always hitting on people, including the looks-to-be-twelve-but-says-she's-fourteen-and-wears-the-same-bikini-every-day-because-it's-the-only-skimpy-one-she-has chick, and was generally just kind of annoying
But then last night the twins both went down to walk on the beach with this blond girl and her little siblings
(Yes, they thought they were Big Pimpin
')   The Dark One was telling us about how Twin A is about to hook up with Blondie, but Twin B won't take the hint and leave
'Whenever someone's about to have a good time, [Twin B] is just taggin' along,' he stated
He actually said 'have a good time,' but he had great abs, so we'll ignore that for just a little longer
So then the twins and Blondie and the two little kids came walking up the boardwalk just as the Dark One is proclaming Twin B to be an annoying 'bitch
' Jules and I hushed them, because generally speaking, people don't usually like their friends to overhear them when they're talking about them
That, however, seems to be a Georgian trait, because they were all macho and 'I don't care!' and crap
So the Dark One, who we know is his best friend, jokes loudly that twin B is a bitch or something
Then the little dude started in, following along, and he called out 'Tagalong!'   I don't know
This just pissed me off
This kid lies about his age and acts all 'suave,' trying to get in with the older guys, but he's basically just been a pig
Every time I was there, he'd be talking about some girl's face or hair or body
And now, he's pulling the classic dis-people-to-look-cool trick? That old trick of climbing the social ladder, right? You have to kick others out of the way
Dear God
I know it was just some stupid pubescent male, and it was people who will never care again
But the principle of it! Where do you get off?   Jules looked at me, and I paused and said to him, 'Wow
That was
biting
' I was being so obviously facetious that sarcasm was dripping from my fangs
Jules giggled
The little guy: 'Well, I don't care
I'm never gonna see him again after this week
You think I'm ever gonna see him again after this week?'   I looked at him
'I mean
that was just so witty
And so cruel
'   Little Dude: 'I don't care
He's a tagalong bitch
' Or some shit like that
So I kind of looked at him for a minute, trying to see if he was serious
Like, he honestly thought that I found his attempted insult to be funny, clever and oh-so-not-repetitive
He made a big show then, getting Twin B away from Twin A and the girl, and, like, dragging him off, and so then it was just me and Jules and Dark One in the pool
I think Dark One had some inkling of suspicion that there was something mildly ironic occuring, so he started doing cannonballs into the pool
Jules and I just treaded water for a minute, looking back at where the little asshole had disappeared
'He's the bitch,' she told me
Bono at Wheaton:  urlLink my thoughts
This weekend has been a long and arduous one
Whenever a group of friends seems -- emphasis on  seems  -- at odds with each other, good things usually do not ensue
However, things seem to have been worked out and maybe, just maybe, I can go back to the old way of doing things
Yes, I know I'm sounding like a traditionalist but hey, if it's broke don't fix it
Sure, it may be rough around the edges, but the more times we get cut by it, the more chances we have to smooth it out
What the hell am I talking about? Anyway
now stepping into the non-metaphorical world
it's time for me to head out
Got things to do tonight
and away we go
&nbsp;  Phase 1 of eating better
I am following the South Beach Diet
Low Carbs, good protein and good fat
bye bye, breads (although sourdough is okay), croutons (a sad loss), regular soda, fast food, candy, and cupcakes (now I'm sad)
&nbsp;  I know that a lot of people don't agree with dieting, but for someone like myself, I need something strict or it won't work
I have often found that one person's way of losing weight is not the best way for another
&nbsp;  I need to completely give up my junk food
Oh, the complete sadness
I love hostess cupcakes
And they make me feel so much better when I am depressed
&nbsp;  Eventually, I'd like to write a novel about a woman who loses over 100 lbs
And I feel that my blog would be perfect for me to 'store' ideas, reminders of feelings
and all that good stuff
&nbsp;  Or perhaps, I'll start another 'blog'
urlLink    My cats killed a bird around 5 AM
Good work, guys

2004 Reunion  urlLink     Robert Smith
Above quote is from an interview with the author of I am the Cheese and its a great book and i just think that sounded cool and I want to read all of this other books
Tell me if they're good if you've read any
Sorry for all of the 'and's and stuff I'm kinda tired
I havent posted in a while because Marten ish always on so this might be a little long and boring
Alrighty then, the whole Larry thing started because Thomas didn't want to be called Tommy and he said that if i called him Tommy then he would call me Larry just to bug me but it doesn't bug me too much so I'm trying to get my other friends to call me Larry as well but they either forget or they just don't want to for some reason
=p So far only Pixy calls me that but i think its because he wants to be my boyfriend
wohoo im rambling!! Is it just FCV or do all band rooms smell like socks and old Saltine crackers? I seem to be the only person who gets a little screwed up in the head after jazz band but its probably because everyone else is used to it
I now regret not trading my bass guitar in for the mushroom shaped one
It was really pretty and i could've traded my Westone for it but I didn't so now I want it but I have to wait until next year to trade
BTW whats wrong with gossip?!?! Some gosip can be good gossip! Most everything I say is gossip anyways
(sry for all the 'I's I didn't capitalize in the haste of writing this post) SQuEE! what are we revolting against my brother for? he could take us all off the member list and we wouldnt be able to post anymore
Mondays
For obvious reasons
Although my current job does make it easier for me to deal with them
On this particular Monday, as with many Mondays recently, I am finding it hard to concentrate and hence I find ways to procrastinate
No, I am not charging clients for this, of course
Oh, the other thing I'm not comfortable with
Crushes
They're like hiccups
I thought I was all done with them as of a decade or so ago
I've never had hiccups in ten years, and I was hoping that I would never have another one, nor would I ever have another crush
The similarities between the two?  Lack of control
Will power has nothing to do with it; they are involuntary bodily functions
And you always feel stupid during and after they are happening, especially if they're loud and obvious
I shouldn't be having any crushes, doing any crushing, at this age
Is that what this is?  It's different than before
I thought crushes, by definition, were contingent upon physical attraction, but I guess I was wrong, because apparently I have a crush on a woman without even knowing what she really looks like
Uh oh, you're thinking, this guy has lost it
And that's my whole point
Remember that movie 'You've Got Mail?'  Cheesy and sappy come to mind
How do I get myself into such situations
shiiiiiiittttt!  i didnt realize that when i posted a comment on beth's blog that it posted my blog's address
i've been using this to write everything
i think i've written some not so nice things about specific people and named them and i dont want them to read what i said about them when i was upset/mad
i hope they know if they read this that i love them
but i know they'll take it personally because i know i have taken it personally when i've read stuff about myself in other people's journals
i dont want to delete all of those entries tho because they are a part of my life
we were just talking about that today at allen's pond
how we shouldnt post people's business or whatever on journals
i thought i was ok because i hadnt given out this address
i'm stupid
its not that i dont want people to know about my life, and i think i would have given it out eventually
i think what it comes down to at the end of the day is that i'm not happy and there are a lot of things i dont like about myself or my life
i'm super stressed and i just needed a way to vent, which was this blog
but now i feel like i have to hold back and i dont like that
i dont know what i'm gonna do
maybe God wanted me to post on beth's blog to get my life out in the open
i dont know
i have so many secrets
well not really
but a couple big ones
and i'm scared to open up to someone about them
i'm scared for people to know certain sides of me because i'm afraid they'll look at me differently and wont like me or whatever
for now, i'm worried about yvonne
i tried calling her earlier, but she didnt pick up
i dont want her to be depressed, but i feel useless also
i know megan would make her happy
i dont know what to say
all i can do for now is just to be there for her and pray for her
anyway, i went to sacred heart mass today
music was HORRIBLE!  i did see anne abeta though so that was nice
so father perry is a monsignor now
i dont know how i feel about that one
and he kept saying how he still wanted the parish, his 'family,' to call him father
yeah right
shit i really have to think
there has to be a reason why this happened, but i feel like i messed up and i dont know what to do
Well, its official
Chris Pirillo has spilled the beans about his separation from Gretchen
It is a sad sad weekend for all Gnomies out there and the Geek world altogether
I will surely miss the  silly videos Chris makes of his wife
I have been talking to people close to Gretchen and Chris
Heres an excerpt of what one of them is saying: 'I'm not sure where the word is getting around about Chris and Gretchen, but it really is their personal life, and I hope people are respecting that
For the record, I have known about it for many months, only because Gretchen is a good friend of mine and she chose to talk to me about it
I hope the rumors aren't spreading too far
it concerns me
'  And as for me, I am deeply saddened that there is one less geek with out  a model for a companion
Okay now on with the holiday cheer
Happy Hannukah!  From now  until Wednesday there will be Eight Days of the Festival of Lights!  Cheers!
I'm in a damn good mood
Paper is done
It sucks, but it's done
My room is almost clean
Meh, it's close enough
Happy happy happy! No good reason, really
Just am
Although I think it may have something to do with Elliott Smith
Won't you follow me down to the Rose Parade?  People are fun(ny)
I am lucky to have a friend like Shashwath
Today 20/7/2004
He helped me to get my eligibility certificates form the university of Kerala………
he really care for me
He treats me as his brother
Thank you god for giving me such good friends&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
For at least a year now I have wanted a coat rack with a shelf for helmets to hang on my wall in the front door hallway
I did a ton of searching in stores and catalogs and could not find what I wanted
So a little while back I drew up what I wanted and presented it to Mark's brother, Eric
He is an absolute wonder with wood
There is nothing the guy can't build
He built my coat rack
Mark brought it home recently and spent this weekend staining it and putting the hooks on it
It is now hanging up in my hallway and it is beautiful
Maybe now I will get my kitchen table back

i've made up my mind to know without your eyes inside my palms upon waking,  to live upon  a poem--fast and thick, stinking of marshmallows and softener
oh, the white taste, the alien couch, the expensive scotch, and the questions i cannot answer because they are so simple that i think too much about them:  escape from them
we would recite Rilke in the dark, crying over life
i would say: 'oh, i thought you'd need me, but i cannot live without you
'  [now, in losing my spirit, i can listen for money
]  still, a dragonfly dancing over a rainbow pond, a miracle in this world, saffron and cardamom, cinnamon and myrrh, in a gilded church with windows as big  as cradles and candles  of burning fingernails,  begs me to believe you
i meet you inside a book: its pages rustle, crumble, and turn

Yesterday I had to work up in Mohawk from 4pm to 12am for free of course without any compusation
Thats 31 hours in the office and 54 hours out of the office on-call this week
(*Drum Roll*)Making a total of 85 hours this week!!!! FUCK ME
Getting back to my day:  I planned ahead and went to get a movie: The Butterfly Effect (a good movie, love the extras about chaotic dynamical systems, hehe math) and a Xbox game: Hitman Contracts
So you would expect everything to be on the good, but on the way back my car's battery light came on and I have no clue why
Today I went to get in my car and it wouldn't work, but gave it a second try and it worked
I went to drop of the game and movie just incase there was something wrong with the car figuring it should at least run until I turn it off again
So I go to blockbuster without having take a shower, wearing the same clothes from yesterday and my hair is all messed up
So on the way back from blockbuster my car finally died again (3rd time this summer)
I called the tow truck and they wont look at the car until Monday, and I had to walk home
I decided to walk since I was only 1 hr walk away from home, but 1 hr of walking sucks when wearing loose jeans that fall down, unwash hair and the warm sun beaming down
Hey Im a Comp Sci major, if I see the sun more then once a year it was to much
To include in the walk I had my backpack full with my xbox and stuff adding weight on my tired shoulder
I get home and rest for an hour and a half before I go back into the office again
I'm here in the office trying to waste time, I wrote a review of the Hitman:Contracts for the  urlLink 4GBG

I'm pretty new to the knitalong, too
We're in the middle of moving, and just regained our internet connection today after a week long interruption
I'll be sure to post my progress just as soon as I find my digital camera
I'm working the short rows for the bust shaping
I read the directions several times and think I understand what to do, but wanted to double check with some of you as well
Directions say to work short rows once for C-cup and twice for D-cup, etc
Would that mean to wrap 12 stitches on each side instead of 6 for a D-cup? Thanks for the input!
Memorial Day weekend turned out much better than I'd expected for an unplanned series of barbecues and get-togethers
Jerm and I spent Friday night cuddling and being happy about having a whole weekend together, but Jerm was really tired from working to much, so I made chicken barley soup and tried to get him to take it easy for the evening
I wasn't entirely successful, but we had a tasty dinner and went to bed by 11:30, much earlier than normal
We woke up very late, at about 10:00, but it felt so nice to get so much sleep
I made coffee and breakfast while Jerm slept later, and then we decided to go to Target and Ikea, to get a soap pump for the bathroom and to look at entertainment consoles to replace the black behemoth we have currently
On the way, we saw Dave and Alexa getting into their car after getting breakfast on Macarthur, and Jerm called them and asked if they wanted to come
After some initial waffling, they met us at Target in San Leandro that's I'd never been to before
There was just way too much stuff at Target, and Alexa and I looked at shoes and clothes until Dave got impatient with all of us and we had to go back home
We traded cars so we were all in the WRX and went to Ikea, which was a madhouse as always
Jerm and I looked at so many different tv tables, and through various misunderstandings and miscommunications had a fight, so we decided to eat
Yay, Ikea cafe! I had the manager's special and ate way too many meatballs
I should have gotten a lingonberry soda though
That would've been tasty too
Then we wandered through the rest of the store and no one ended up buying anything
Oh well
We all went back to our homes and then reconvened for dinner--this time barbecued apple chicken sausages, veggie skewers, and a big salad
Oh, and a lot of sangria
Whenever the four of us hang out, you can count on booze!  Sunday was devoted to cleaning and reading
Or at least, that was our intention
Jerm and I read the newspaper and had breakfast first, then we finally got going
Fiona and I had made plans to hang out at some point during the weekend, so we decided Sunday night would be good
This was of course not without angst, especially on Jerm's side, but I agreed to make dinner again, and I'd pick her up at BART at 7pm
So as Jerm is emptying the contents of the garage into the driveway, he decides that what he needs are shelves, and Dave is the one to help him
At about 6pm he leaves to meet Dave, Alexa and their truck at Home Despot so he can buy lumber
and I can't leave the house while he's gone, because someone needs to keep an eye on all of the stuff in the driveway
So I start cooking dinner, and getting that in motion, and by 6:45 Jerm calls saying Fiona called, and he's going to pick her up
oh, and Dave and Alexa will come by and hang out tonight too
So I add more food to the stew, and suddenly I'm descended upon by starving hoards
But it was fun
Fi, Alexa and I watched The Big Lebowski while Jerm and Dave built shelves in the garage
We drank a lot and stayed up too late, and I got up early to take Fi to Orinda
but I'll tell you about Monday in another post
Too much good stuff to tack onto the end of this post
Good times
well, my faking sick worked and people are being so nice to me at work today
:) i worked hard and i think i accomplished what i wanted to yesterday
i'll find out when i see my boss today at my ' other ' job
i want to talk about the  urlLink State of the Union address last night
if you wanna read it first, go ahead
first thing i thought: mr
Bush has a really good speech writer
when it was on TV, his face got in the way of my paying attention to what he was saying
plus, i tuned in just in time to hear him reading that letter from that little girl (awww!
so cute
the little girl wants to support her country! -- please note sarcasm)
trust me, read it and then listen to it if you want, but reading it makes him seem like a real president
watching or listening just makes you wanna kick him
that man's face does not inspire trust in me
(*y m'inspire pas confiance) you know how you can just tell whether you can trust someone or not
that instinctual gut feeling
alarm bells go off when i look at the President of the USA
annoying fire alarm bells
like at 2am
he bugs me that much
what really bothers me is this whole 'sanctity of marriage'
please
puh-lease
if you really really wanna, how does he put it? 'respect individuals as we take a principled stand for one of the most fundamental, enduring institutions of our civilization
Congress has already taken a stand on this issue by passing the Defense of Marriage Act, signed in 1996 by President Clinton
That statute protects marriage under federal law as a union of a man and a woman, and declares that one state may not redefine marriage for other states
Our nation must defend the sanctity of marriage
'  if you want to do that, Meester Prezident, you might want to outlaw divorce, not love
the 'defence of marriage' act is just a law saying that every state decides, independently of
here, it's complicated lemme just quote: 'No State, territory, or possession of the United States, or Indian tribe, shall be required to give effect to any public act, record, or judicial proceeding of any other State, territory, possession, or tribe respecting a relationship between persons of the same sex that is treated as a marriage under the laws of such other State, territory, possession, or tribe, or a right or claim arising from such relationship
'  it all began when a judge in Hawaii decided to allow same-sex marriage
reps from other states freaked because they were afraid that it would affect their state laws on marriage
so the US government drew up an Act defining marriage as a heterosexual and monogamous act
in other words, if you get married in Hawaii, or in Canada for that matter, when you return to your state, they don't have to recognize the fact that you're married, because you're gay
Hawaii had a vote and rejected that judge's ruling that gay people could marry
one step forward, two steps back
well, i'm fully depressed right now
better get back to my boring job
i haven't gone to the gym yet this week
my reason is that i left my gym clothes at N's house and haven't had the time (or the inclination) to go and get them
tonight perhaps
i wonder what has to happen in our world for people to realize that homosexuals are people too
Did you know that Dick Cheney's (the Vice-Prez'z) daughter is a lesbian?  oh the times, they are a-changin'
i have confidence that things will get better, that the US government will become more open-minded
they're a bit behind the times, we'll have to forgive them
another prayer perhaps?  let the babies of the 1970s, 80s and 90s be more open-minded about the world than our fathers' fathers, especially when it comes to love
STILL ON HIATUS      I'm taking a break from blogging this week to attend to the following:  1) Several interviews with a major publishing company
2) Sever ties with an old friend who has become tiresome and dysfunctional (but how to break this to him has yet to be decided)
3) Resume my rigid workout schedule and train for next month's Chicago Marathon (I think I can break 4:20!) 4) Find someone's Rosh Hashana dinner to crash (L'shana Tova to my all of my Jewish friends!) 5) Get in on that poker game with the dawgs
Welcome to, “Condensed Cream of Book for Busy People Who Want to Know, But Don’t Have Time to Read a Whole Book and All” by Pauline Cunningham
Today’s selection is entitled: “Robot Building for Dummies” (seriously) By: Roger Arrick   OK…I’m not really certain how to even BEGIN to mock this
(Or, rather, condense this
)  Yes
If you’re a “dummy” I’m pretty sure that you aren’t thinking,  “I say
I could really use a robot
By Jove, why don’t I just build one? Oh golly, I guess I should have paid more attention during those cybernetics courses I took
And I’m beginning to really regret skipping so many of my atomic circuit board lessons
I know
I’ll just pick up a “dummy” book
”    No, it’s more like,  “Hey, Skeeter! I dun think Mama’s gone to that big trailer park in the sky ‘cuz I keep pokin’ her with the cattle prod an she still ‘aint moved in 3 weeks! We need one a them there metal men to cook up that possum afore it dun gits rank
Why don’t we fetch us that there “dummy” book an make us one!”    Hell-O! Because you’re a DUMMY! Jeez
Dummies like me are going, “Robot? Oh that’s just great
Because I’m already picking up after a slew of LIVING beings, why don’t I just start cleaning up nuts and bolts too?” How about having something besides the dog’s ass that will leave snail trails across the floor? I really need yet ANOTHER machine for my husband to “work on” all weekend because the cars and computers aren’t enough
Oh that’d be great…  “Honey, I’ll be down in the lab creating simulated life! Call me when dinner’s ready, OK”?   Sure baby
If you’re dumb enough to think a robot will make your life easier, you’re definitely too dumb to build one
This “dummies” thing has just gone too far
It’s getting cruel
What book am I going to find next? “Illiteracy for Dummies”, with the audio version for the deaf? Or the audio version read by Sally Struthers for the blind? What the hell? What about “How to make it in Politics for Dummies”
No, wait, that’s required reading
Next week, “Picking your crap up off the Floor for Dummies”
If I get it written in time
Yeah, oops
Informative  feature , not article
I think it would be cool if there was a CHS blogring out there, so we all know who does the blog
So far I only know of about a handful of blogs, only three juniors and the rest being seniors
I was thinking, though, that maybe a group blog (this, unfortunately, is not a true group blog, yet) might be a cool idea, but it could/would only be done if at least five people wanted in and would post on a regular basis
While on that subject, there's officially four of us here
Yeah, four? I see three
Shyaam, our nominal member, eh? Yeah, just in case we'd all forgotten about him, he's the 'other guy
' I'd love to say there's room for another lunatic to join us, but then again I can't exactly  say  it, can I?  Advertising pitch over
Ok, they wouldn't be quite so bad if I would get together everything I need for work the night b/4
But nnnoooooo
I'm always too tired Sunday night
I always figure there isn't that much to do, it won't take but a minute
Hah!  Silly me
I end up running around the apartment grabbing things: water bottle--drat needs refilling, prepare my ice tea in a travel cup, toss everything back into the purse, grab the contact lens stuff from the bathroom, etc
I always end up leaving at least 10 mins
later than I should
Thank goodness alot of kids are out of school for the summer, so traffic is much lighter
Finding a place to park once I get to work is becoming a major hassle
There are more people working & the female who lives in the house right behind the office/showroom is a freakin' weirdo
She has several people living with her, & feels she's entitled to the whole side street
My coworkers & I have been parking there for like a million years
She just moved there a couple years ago or so, & figures she can take over
Last summer, anytime someone parked in front of the alley directly behind URA's building, she started leaving notes on the windshield telling them they cannot park there
She'd sign it 'The Mayburn neighborhood' or something like that
One of my coworkers beat on her door & told her she was a stupid bitch & to never go near her car again
It eventually became my turn for the note receiving
Then she started laying in wait for me to get to my car & she'd chase me down
Once she called the police
I was still at work at the time
They left as I got out there so I didn't think much of it
That was the second time she chased after me
By that time TC had already talked to the police
They said the street is public property & she has no business telling people (us) we can't park there
So, she tells me she had the police out
I asked her what did they say
She said 'Never mind what they said
'  I told her I already knew what they told her--the same thing they told us
She asked what that was
I told her that it's a public street, not exclusively belonging to her & we have every right to park there
She tells me that by her living in a house, that gives her more 'power' to park there
I told her only in her dreams
We've been there a whole lot longer than her
I then suggested she go to city hall & find out exactly where her property line is
She went back into her house
Anyhoo, I had no choice but to park on the street next to her driveway one day last week
After work, there was a note on my windshield telling me she must have all those parking spaces for everyone living at her house
She puts in the note that I should park in front of the house across the street from her (which doesn't happen to have a driveway, so where are those people supposed to park?)
The next day, again, no where else to park
So I left a big note on my own dashboard saying 'If you come anywhere near this car, I will call the police & report you vandalizing this car and for you stalking me
'  What do you know, no notes from she-whacko on my windshield
'course I'm not sure if she even looked, but oh well
Yan kasi ayaw mag-share kung paano
I don't like this feeling of failure
Thank you to my friends who have been listening to me, and helping provide support and opinions/advice
I really do appreciate it more than you will ever know
Its cold
And god damn Road Runner, stop disconnecting and then not having the cable light go on
And UR, stop trying to delete my website

(actually from 7
04) yes this is edition 2 of the weekly top 5
this is a big step towards consistency, as i have not yet forgotten about this
about 2 more of these and i would think that this will have been solidified as a definite 'department' of the blog
without much further ado, this weeks top 5 is: 'things i heard the most at camp'  5) 'hows it going, hoppy?' according to camp lore, hoppy is some guy from 100 years ago who was made fun of bc he had a curved spine and a short leg
to make a long story short, he was found dead in a cave, frozen to death while clutching a fawn to keep it warm
since i was kind of hopping around (w/ crutches) this nickname was bestowed upon me, and it spread quite quickly
it could be worse i guess
4) 'hows the ankle?' pretty self-explanatory
as you hear this question more and more, you kind of get a default answer without many details once you realize that they dont want to know that badly
3) 'i have to pee' to be expected w/ 3rd grade guys
we had a buddy system, which grew much more relaxed as the week progressed
my response went from 'get your buddy' to 'just go in the woods or something'
peeing in the woods is part of the camp experience, right?  2) 'my (insert authority figure, usually male, such as dad/grandpa) can (insert impressive feat that is usually doubled in exaggeration)' as covered yesterday, these kids still idolize their parents/whoever else
some of these stories were obviously fabricated, some were probably true
another fun thing that came up a lot about parents was personal information such as diets/weight/age of parents
these parents might want to rethink telling the kids this stuff
1) 'what did you do to your ankle?/how did you manage THAT?' imagine telling about 100 people (literally) that your injury was from something as dumb as jumping off of a slide from 1 foot off the ground
i would have liked my injury to have been from something a bit more respectable, maybe i dived into the pool to save a kid from drowning or something like that
humility is a good thing
there you have it
i am off to watch some us olympic trials for track & field now, then a 2-hour special on trading spaces! (yes i am quite serious, i happen to enjoy that show, and no, this does not mean i am gay) some of the designers on the other hand
I started workin for The Man today
The attorney I'll be working with is a deadhead, has a picture of Bob Dylan in his office, and is vegan
Are you surprised to know that he does mostly environmental and criminal environmental litigation?  2
Aunt + Uncle + 2 small children came into town today
How can I put this delicately?  Oh wait, I can't:  I don't like small children
I also don't like it when relatives invite themselves, and then in response to any idea of things to do, automatically say, 'No
I don't want to do that,' and then look at me expectantly
This is especially so because I've put some research effort into these ideas
Lady, I don't know much about this city except where to get totally wasted, but I've tried to look into things we can do with kids, that the whole family would enjoy, not just one drunk law student
If you summarily veto all my ideas, hey, I'm going to run out eventually, and neither of us will be happy
I got my Con Law grade back
Haha!!  They're putting me in Speshul Ed Law next semester
But hey, I'm cool with that, I hear we get to color our casebooks
I edit a quarterly dealy-bob called  Living Springs
Here's a link to the lastest issue, focused on  urlLink peacebuilding
Email me at  urlLink eggbert  and let me know what you think
&nbsp; I find myself getting more involved with other peoples blogs
There are currently 2 blogs i take an active interest in
One's funny yet dramatic, the other's full of self searching
What's mine? Well, judging from previous posts, it appears that I seem to have too much gaming in my head!  Maybe I should cut down on the gaming posting and concentrate on my personal self
I guess maybe I haven't gotten to that stage yet
Here's a go:  I find Decision-making that affects my personal life is usually one of the hardest things to do
Why do I constantly attempt to pursue that which others believe to be impossible? Am I looking for drama to spice up my life? That's what comes when one reads too much or watches too many movies full of ideals, romanticism and hopes
Why can I not accept the norm, or go for that which is a safe decision? I cannot answer this, but I do know I cannot!  I will try
&nbsp; and I can only hope that the other will attempt the same
Till then
So, today was friday or more appropriately still is friday and was by far the most uneventful friday ever
Except after school when me and anne and addi became the 3 headed blob
I don't know if we ever formally called ourselves that but we were quite blob-ish
We entertained the masses (if masses are like 4 people who didn't even stay for the whole song) with our renditions of three blind mice, row row row your boat, my bonnie lies over the ocean and um
something else i don't remember
I decided that when I grow up I want to be a dog
All they do is lay around and eat and chase their tail
I wish I could be a dog but then again I probably wouldn't like the fur
On the Countability of Algebraic Numbers      [10/6
1]    A real number is  urlLink algebraic  if it satisfies some polynomial of positive degree such that:  x n  + a 1 &middot;x n-1  +
+ a n-1 &middot;x + a n   with rational coefficients a i
Assuming each polynomial equation has finitely many roots, show that the set of algebraic numbers is countable
The  urlLink fundamental theorem of algebra states  that if P(x) is a polynomial of degree  n , then the equation P(x) = 0 has  n  roots
Since we know that the roots of the above equation are dependent upon the coefficients (for example, x 1  + a 1  = 0 involves -a 1  as the solution), and since we have the fundamental theorem of algebra, we can say that the number of solutions for a polynomial of degree  n  can be found by taking all possible rational coefficients, and crossing them with a set of  n  elements:  Let A n  be the set Q &times; Q &times; Q &times;
&times; Q by {a 1 ,a 2 ,
,a n }, and let B n  be any set of n elements, such as {1,1,
We know that the number of solutions for a polynomial of degree n can be found by A n  &times; B n , which amounts the set of  n  sets of rational numbers crossed with a set of  n  elements
Thus, the union of A n  &times; B n  for all  n  in Z +  gives us all possible algebraic numbers
Because A n  is a finite cartesian product of countable sets, and B n  is a finite set, the cross product of any given A n  and B n  must be countable (the finite product of countable sets is countable)
Finally, we can say that our countable union of a countable set is countable; thus, the algebraic numbers are countable
If this proof or any other material contained on this blog appear to be incorrect, please  urlLink e-mail  me!  Thanks
netscape sets the update view differently than explorer
or at least that's the only thing I have to explain the difference
ANYWAY
I went to class this morning only to find a note on the door saying that lab would be starting at 11am instead of 10am
WTF? I wanted to go to class, turn in my lab report, take the stupid test and leave
Now I'm stuck with an hour of odd time without anything to do
at least nothing productive anyway
I'm once again procrastinating a programming project
It's hard to get things done when the prof keeps moving the due date
It's one of his most annoying qualities, that and the fact that he never returns homework assignments
*sigh* I just want this semester to be over with
Not that I know what I'm going to do once I graduate, but whatever it is
it's got to be better than this
Or at least I'm hoping it will be
Dave is home on leave for two weeks
It's nice to have him home, while at the same time frustrating as we're used to living on our own
not to mention the fact that he's actually keeping normal hours, which in itself is odd
Still, I'd much rather have him here than in Iraq
Troy came over last night
that was a trip
well, he's Troy and there's really nothing more that can be said about that
30 more mins
think I have time to go home and take a nap? argh
Today is July 2nd
Do you know what is going to happen exactly 12 years from today?  I do
urlLink     Scott Richter, the president of OptInRealBig, is known as the 'spam king' (even though he's only the world's third biggest spammer, according to  urlLink spamhaus )
You have almost certainly received email from this man before
urlLink OptInRealBig  has a pretty professional looking website for a company that sells penis enlargement pills, it seems strange to me that Richter would even try to appear on the up and up
urlLink Then again  'his 28-employee company, OptInRealBig, clears $2 million in sales each month
He drives a Lexus convertible and a Lexus SUV, owns a half-million-dollar home outside Denver
'    Richter and some of his associates were recently  urlLink sued  by the New York Attorney General Elliot Spitzer:   With cooperation from Microsoft, the New York Attorney General's Office tracked these e-mail messages to identify separate marketing campaigns that passed through 514 IP addresses around the world
The investigation identified Richter in Colorado and his partners in Washington, Texas and New York as responsible for the campaigns
They also determined that the e-mail messages were developed and sent in violation of the law
Some appeared to come from a foreign government's defense ministry, others from a hospital, and still more from elementary and high schools
According to the lawsuits, those spam e-mail messages used other people's sender names, false subject lines, fake server names, inaccurate and misrepresented sender addresses, or obscured transmission paths, all in violation of New York and Washington state law
Recently Richter unveiled a 'Spam King' clothing line and was promptly  urlLink threatened  by Hormel, the makers of SPAM the pork product 'food
'  Hormel makes their position clear on the  urlLink SPAM website :    You've probably seen, heard or even used the term 'spamming' to refer to the act of sending unsolicited commercial email (UCE), or 'spam' to refer to the UCE itself
Following is our position on the relationship between UCE and our trademark SPAM
Use of the term 'spam' was adopted as a result of the Monty Python skit in which our SPAM meat product was featured
In this skit, a group of Vikings sang a chorus of 'spam, spam, spam
' in an increasing crescendo, drowning out other conversation
Hence, the analogy applied because UCE was drowning out normal discourse on the Internet
We do not object to use of this slang term to describe UCE, although we do object to the use of the word 'spam' as a trademark and to the use of our product image in association with that term
Also, if the term is to be used, it should be used in all lower-case letters to distinguish it from our trademark SPAM, which should be used with all uppercase letters
Note that one of the first commercial spammings was  urlLink committed by attorneys  Canter and Siegel in 1994 to advertise their immigration law services
Surprised?  More articles  urlLink here  and  urlLink here , thanks to  urlLink The Trademark Blog  for pointing out the recent lawsuit
I stayed up until 5 AM on both Friday and Saturday nite
I have been writing songs and listening to the Walkmen's new album
I have been thinking about Diner Boy and trying to realize that it is never going to happen
I have been trying to be happy, while my friends fall in and out of love
And I am still stuck on the same boy, who can only stop by my table, say hi and smile at me for 2 minutes and leave
I have been invited to a 'rip your heart out before someone else does' party on Valentine's Day
I want to wear pink and red and stay up until 5 AM and avoid love because it is too mentally damaging for me
As I said above, I did post on the Mob forum about the Betfair situation, and I also admit that I have made contributions to the 'Celebrity Poker' threads under an assumed name
If anyone does care you can probably guess which one but I doubt if you do [care]
But it does take a lot to make me pop my head above the walls and post on there nowadays, as the quality of debate, if you can call it that, reaches new depths
Currently the forum is flooded with posts by or about (or both) one particular individual
While these are unintentionally amusing at times (I did enjoy the central figure's assertion in about his 534th post that 'I bring home the money and that's all I care about) but mostly it's a total turn-off
I couldn't care less how much an individual makes, there will always be a few winners and a lot of losers
If you're doing well good luck to you
But if you do value a forum, always remember that trolls thrive on ANY kind of response
Starve them of this oxygen and they will, in a cyberspace sense, die
Bear it in mind
Much humor herein, for those who care to poke around

Welcome to, “Condensed Cream of Book for Busy People Who Want to Know, But Don’t Have Time to Read a Whole Book and All” by Pauline Cunningham
Today’s Condensed Cream of Book is: “The Dictionary” By: A bunch of guys   I know you’re all thinking, “Whoa, what kind of lazy-ass crap is this? What? Did she sit down at her desk, take a big slug of nasty, day-old coffee, spew it back out all over the piles of junk lying everywhere, and as she was cleaning off the dictionary said, ‘Good enough
’?”  I just don’t know where you people get this stuff
My intense research often requires me to get out of bed
And sometimes even to get dressed
So today, (as my mother would say) you’ll get the dictionary and you’ll like it!  I myself hate it
I can’t spell worth beens
This is definitely a disadvantage in writing
First my spell-check nicely highlights everything in red, just as a little, “Ha, Ha
You must be a bit bleary-eyed today! Let me just ‘remind’ you how to spell ‘anaconda’
” So I go in and let it re-spell the word for me in whatever bizarre ancient-Grecian way its “suppose” to be spelled, then it asks to re-check my entire document
“NO!”  I’m always emphatic about this because checking my whole document means half a day of this insidious machine highlighting every word
It laughs at me with it’s little bell and says, “Did you mean…anthrax/antelope/anomaly?”   “NO!”   Then we argue for a bit, going back and forth until the spell check starts to get angry, its bell starts to “gong” in a “WRONG” sort of tone, then it starts running out of words and asks things like, “Is it animal, vegetable or mineral? Is it bigger than a breadbox? Do you speak-a-da-ENGLISH?” Then it starts to throw off sparks and smoke and we both give up and I’m forced to turn to the PAPER Dictionary
Which, as it turns out, is only good for people who know how to SPELL! And why else would you look up a word? To find it’s meaning? Puh-leez!   So then I’m stuck going through all of the “A’s”- A-N-A, A-N-N-A, A-N-H-A… then I forget for a while what the word was in the first place
Then I pretend I’m not even really looking at the dictionary
I put it down and pretend I’m looking over THERE somewhere, while I’m really looking at it out of the corner of my eye
Then suddenly I pounce on it and we wrestle, with me screaming, “Give me my word dammit!” Then I chuck it into the corner of the room where it lies deviously with its vile pages rustling fiendishly at me
Laughing
Always laughing…
Then I call my husband and ask him how to spell the word and he informs we it’s with an “O” or something incredibly stupid, and it’s not the dictionary’s fault, really
So I pick it up, throw it back on my desk and say, “Well alright, THIS time you can stay, but you better just watch yourself mister!”  So if I were you, I wouldn’t even bother getting a dictionary because they really aren’t good for anything as far as I can tell, and they’re also made of pure, refined evil
All right, I’ve got coffee I have to soak up before it oozes down into the keys here, and geez, I’d really hate for it to disengage my spel-chek
Wednesday to you, dorks
It's quiet in the halls of the place that gives me money for porn
Maybe the soccer moms are planning an attack
Battlestations! A lady stopped me in the hall today, 'Just so you know, my 22-year-old daughter fell off my scooter
' 'Oh yeah?  I once rode a bike off of a cliff and smacked my nuts on the handle bar when I landed
So, who wins the stupid story contest, lady?' Actually, I just filed her babble-dabble under 'Useless Stranger/Daughter Scooter Related Injuries' in my brain and went on my way
Not much of words back from place me want work
Send e-smokesignals today as requested by chief, short word back thanking for pow-wow
Not respond again, young brave not want seem pushy
Brent, did you yell at a foreign person or a retarded person last night? Both
I went to buy some beers at a gas station
This chick in front of me accidently dropped a bottle of girly smirnoff drink
'I will pay for it,' she said
'What happens, man?' said the unruly store clerk
Mumble, grumble, bumble (stopped paying attention for a few seconds because I noticed even NEWER flavors of Doritos!) Then
'You don't have to call me stupid!' said the girl
'What happens, man?'said clerk ass again
'Your boyfriend got the gas, outside the pump, go him,' said retard
Girl walks out followed by clerk and jerk
They seem to all have a little talk in the parking lot
When they come back in I decide that the place is too weird and put the beer back
'Sir, I help you!' 'You guys are weird, I'm leaving
' So, I get to the car and R
Waiting asks me 'What the hell was going on in there?' I explain, she tells me that the guys were yelling at the girl in the parking lot while her boyfriend just sat there
'Hmmm,' I thought, 'I must really have been into those Doritos, because I missed all of that
' Then I said, 'Not while Batman is around!' 'What?' said R
So, I marched back into the store and looked the clerk right in the eyes
'It's rude to yell at women,' I let him know
Then I looked at old redneck retard
'Rude!' Then I left
I am America's Boyfriend
Later, dorks, it's time for naps!
I need to get the fuck out of the US of A this weekend
In honor of 'merika's birthday, I'm going to Canada
This is one of the best ideas I've had in a really, really long time
So good that celebrating the 4th in Canada may, just may, become an annual event
What's my point?  I don't really have one, but if you know any good places in Vancouver that are not to be missed I need to know about them, like NOW
So go on, tell me where I should go
I'm anxiously awaiting your suggestions
urlLink This  has to be the absolute funniest thing I've ever read
(or at least the funniest thing I've read in the last hour
We English types tend to read a lot
Bah its raining again and the kids are kicking me and I'm tired and sore from sleeping
Im going back to bed
To look life in the face, to know it, to love it and to put it away
Can I just say that 'The Hours' was an amazing movie!  I've always loved V
W's work and wow
So much to think on
WEll, like the title says - if you can read this, the site may indeed be of some use
If not, well, the alternative is obvious
I also want to know: a) what is a contributor? how do they get this position? b) If you place a link - it goes to it automatically - at least Kris's thread did for me - so how do you comment on it? c) has this group of friends cemented itself in its nerdish behavior by creating its own website? d) will the photos from our Summer holiday be available some day in the near future?       -Ken
hahahha

I'm down with a Flu Blog back in two If it's still inside me Blog back in three  AAAACHOOOOOOO! Sniff! coffeeshopguy  Scribbles> Given enough coffee, I could rule the world
Took a half day today, going to be leaving for Milwaukee soon
I thought I'd finally get  urlLink my moblog  caught up a little before taking off
Started downloading all my pictures off of my sprint picture site so I can finally post all the pictures that for whatever reason didn't get posted before
Also put up a picture on here to spruce up the blandness a little, also changed the template on my moblog because I got bored of the old one
Not-so-blah Monday
Could it be?!  Nothing much in the way of actual events happened today, except for Young Marine stuff
It was fun getting up at 4:30 in the morning, driving out to a cemetery at 5:30, waiting for flags to be placed at veterans' graves to show up for two hours, and then going home when they never did
Then, of course, thirty minutes later I had to go back up to the cemetery for the actual ceremony where we placed the suddenly-present flags by a select group of graves
Good times
Actually, our Company First Sergeant, who's the senior Young Marine in our unit, is about to wrap up her tenure in the Young Marines
She ships off to Big Marines in August, so that's kind of sad
We've been partners for the last four years or so
It's been real
I can't wait to go out to California
I'm supposed to call USC tomorrow--actually, I WAS supposed to call them today--about when their 'Meet USC' summer program is, and I'll be sure to do it tomorrow
I've got to get out of Waco for a little while because it just seems to suck all the life out of me (especially when school's out)
Going out to LA will be a pleasant change from the monotony of the past year
On a happier note, I found out that I could very well have an incredible internship next year in the MISD public relations department
According to Mrs
B (newspaper adviser), the lady who is head of the department asked if I would be willing to intern her (i
write press releases, cover events, etc
) next year
I'm still trying to work out my schedule for next year, but I would love to have the opportunity to do that
That, added on with a possible PR internship at the Dr
Pepper Museum this summer, could put me well on my way to a career in PR
Yeah, I'm stoked
You know it
GOAL UPDATE!  GOAL UPDATE!  I'm writing a song that basically has to be completed by Sunday morning for my mother's birthday since I'll be at LIFE on the Big Day (yeah, it's sad
I know
It's a lot harder than I thought it would be
Last year's just seemed to come out of my fingertips, but this year's is a bit more challening
Ah, well
Nothing like a good ol' musical challenge to get the blood a-flowing!  I've also started my first short story in French
It's actually a lot of fun: it expands my vocabulary while providing practical application for the grammatical aspects of the language that I have learned
I call it  Les superbes aventures de Jules , which translates to 'Jules's Magnificent Adventures
'  Yeah, it's pretty straightforward, but hey, I can't start out writing like Voltaire, now can I?  Hehe, if only I could
Tomorrow it's off to Chili's for a hopeful job interview as well as calling the lady from the MISD PR department
Mmm, I like the taste of summer
Hey Lindsay! Its us - Jackie & Bryan
Our wedding date is October 23, 2004
BE THERE!
Hey carol, happy birthday!
How many times must we go through this, once again, a few more soldiers blown to pieces, yet another family man not being able to spend his last holidays with his family
Is this war really worth it? Or have we made a mistake just like vietnam
well let us clap for Bush, i mean he did catch Sadam but, um
last time i checked the 9/11 attacks were from Osama
thats wild
And don't you think its time to pack the crap up and leave? Before you turn around and find out the body of your relative or friend is being burned and dragged a million miles too?   Latest News: More contractors die
go figure,

i dont know why i did that LOTR thing
maybe its cuz ive got a daddy date tuesday night? urrg yessm
lo siento- gusgus
I just showed HER my blog and she doesn't understand it at all
made a funny face, said  'I'm waiting for my girfriend to bring me sandwiches'  in one of those singsongy voices
Then she asked me how many people I thought would look at my site
I didn't want to let her win, so I responded with 'lots'
I lied
On an unrelated note, I believe that beer is one of God's miracles (especially when it comes in 40-ounce quantities with a budweiser label on it)
i'm here and have been wanting to post about various things but nothing seems to come at the right moment
on saturday i spent the day with family 3 hours away
it was ok
the day was lovely
my family isn't as much and i got to spend hours on my dad's harley with him
that was fun and then a huge storm came and we parked under and overpass and then i ended up riding back with my mom because they were both being parental and it really was a bad storm
i've been much too needy for the situation at hand with lindsay
i'm feeling both frustrated and guilty for being needy
if he were in a great place and stable
some of my neediness would be balanced and with some of those needs being met
much of it would simply disappear
- : - : - : - : - : - : -  he's been pretty much exhausted by stress and his emotions lately
whether he'd admit it or not
i've wanted him so much sexually and have allowed myself to daydream about indulgent pampering i could do to him
i just picture him exhausted and quiet
me, quiet and giving
touching him so soft, spending very slow slow slow drawn out times on his most intimate places yet also easing his most basic muscles
loving him and loving him and knowing inside that he could feel me overflowing all over him
knowing that it was seeping into his pores and soothing him
wrapping him up all safe and warm and comfortable
i love him
- : - : - : - : - : - : -  i bought a bottle of wine after work today
a pinot grigio
i'm working on a list
perhaps more about the list at another time
hell, maybe i'll even post the list when it's 'complete
'  it's not an exhaustive list, though
anyway, how are you?  come and sit a spell with me
have some wine or i'll make you tea
eat some food and talk with  me lots
Just a note on the breaking news in my life
This week I received a letter from Brite Divinity School in Fort Worth
In the letter was notice of my acceptance and my scholarship award
I was given a FULL TUITION award!  I wept when I opened the letter because I never expected such a large award
I am currently waiting on my letter from Vanderbilt University in Nashville
After getting their offer, Jason and I will make our decision about where we will be living and going to school
Keep watch for more news!  Also, Jason received a promotion at his job that will hopefully go through in the next week or so
Though we don't know how much more money this will be, it is a very good move for him in the company
God has certainly rained down his blesssings on us this week!  I want to say thank you to each one of you who have prayed about these things for us
After I was asked to withdraw from Abilene Christian University because I was gay, we were worried about what our future would hold
However, with these wonderful blessings, I will be able to attend school for less money than I paid to attend at ACU, and Jason and I will be financially secure!  Thank you again for your prayers!
Hoje, ao recordar minhas aventuras, fiquei a imaginar alguém, que com certeza me faria muito bem! Pensei em ser amada e possuída, tão violentamente que pudesse tirar de mim toda a razão
Lembrei de ti, homem gostoso! Você, que instigando meus desejos, fêz com que minha ansiedade se dobrasse ao máximo! Como seria bom tê-lo ao meu lado! Dando-me carícias a todo instante, e fazendo-me esquecer que o mundo lá fora existe
Queria estar num lugar aconchegante e confortável contigo
Me desnudando selvagentemente, me desarmando de qualquer defensiva
Abusando de mim, com seus beijos quentes e sedutores! Erguendo-me sob a parede deste lugar, deixando meus gemidos soarem longe
Rasgando minhas roupas, lambendo meus seios e envolvendo meu corpo com suas mãos suaves e delicadas
Nua e sem temor, em teus braços fortes, sendo acariada de todas as formas
Língua com língua, fazendo sexo juntamente conosco
E envolvida por ti, neste ímpeto de paixão e loucura, me deixo abrir por você e ser penetrada com sutileza e ternura! Sentí-lo adentrar em meu corpo, como um furacão em completa erupção
Latejando de vontade e me dando a sensação pura de ser amada e possuída por ti
Gemer e gozar, ao sentir a sua mão em minhas partes íntimas
A cada toque seu, sentir o meu completo orgasmo
Que junto de seus dedos, saem como gotas de prazer
Ah, como me fazes feliz neste momento! Sentir sua boca em meus seios rígidos e famintos, aflorados de calor por este fogo que agora me consome
O suor vertiginoso, desce sobre nossos semblantes
E os nossos corpos, roçam pele a pele, se encaixando num delírio sem fim
Abaixo minha mão, e seguro teu sexo, que muito me extasia e enlouquece! Vou mais adiante, e passo por ele minha língua, que o envolve com toda sua rigidez
Faço com ele, peripécias, que deixam você nas alturas
E sugando-o como á um sorvete, me lambuzo com o seu néctar maravilhoso! Não paramos por aí, e mais eu quero e você também
A cada mordida, a cada exploração, sentimos o nosso coração bater forte e nos entregamos mais e mais
Ouvindo sussurros seus em meus ouvidos, automáticamente me abro, para dar-me mais prazer
E sentindo-o em minhas entranhas, sinto-me a mulher mais realizada do universo! Nossos corpos queimam, e flutuamos de intenso êxtase
Podemos neste instante, inebriados de total entrega, gozarmos juntinhos
E os nossos gritos desta vez, parecem ensurdecedores
Chegamos ao clímax, e agora descansamos um sobre o corpo do outro
Almejamos mais, e depois de descansados um pouco, viro-me na cama para olhar para ti
A sensação de furor, volta alucinada e mais forte ainda! Nos damos um beijo caliente, e logo a seguir, sua língua é sentida em todo o meu corpo
Que sensação mágica e adorável! Sua língua em meus seios, em minha cintura, em meus quadris e se arrastando para minha intimidade
Deliro a cada movimento seu! Grito a você que pare e insistentemente continuas com sua língua em minhas partes genitais
Quero-te dentro do meu corpo, mais queres primeiro me esvainecer de tanta loucura! Gozo a cada segundo, a cada toque seu
E bebes meu líquido ardente, sentindo em sua boca, o gosto suave e febril de todo o meu desejo
Ao sentir-me desfalecida de tantas emoções gostosas, sobe em cima da cama e me deixas cavalgar sobre ti
Encaixo-me por cima, como a domar um poldro
E ouço seus gemidos loucos, e frenéticos a me pedir por mais
Suas mãos, passeiam em meu corpo, e seguram meus seios para sua boca chupá-los
E ambos, damos prazer um ao outro
Beijos, mãos, seios, cavalgam junto comigo
E depois de tanta selvageria e amor, novamente terminamos abraçados, como agradecidos por mais esta delícia de momento!

com : After Bush received the designation of being the only US President to skip out on every NAACP convention while in office, they returned the favor, and rightly so, by calling for his defeat in the November elections
Okay this post is a little abstract but I'm tryin' to kill sometime before I can drink some liquids
Okay I have found the love of my life and it's called 30 minute meals on Food Network - I bow to that show and Rachel Ray
today she made these 'Uber nachos' and *still drooling over it*   I got a new credit card today and before I could enjoy it I found out that the company already took 178
00 in fees! I was like 'Just when I think I'm getting ahead
'   Today's food fest wasn't so great - I had a hot dog which was great but 'lunch' was intresting at first I tried frozen chicken tenders but *yuck* then frozen speghetti and meatballs *yuck* I just had a deviled egg but even that wasn't as good as yesterday
maybe we have something else for later tonight   Tomorrow I'm going to try tortilla chips - after I go the gym (counter productive I know) and finally paying off my late fees at Blockbuster - I had the money this weekend but :( decided to go shirt shopping instead
I talked to my non-encouraging best friend Amanda today - and she (Nat, Leslie & Melissa) thought my shirt was nuts and nothing good will come of it - it's kinda sad but I can never decide if she's being serious or joking
Hmmm all this talk of Greg being on Greta and Rita these past few days I guess I'll have to watch Fox after The Factor tonight

Had my own freak weather occurence today - fortunately, it didn't result in my being washed away
though it might have had it kept up
So, I was out on my usual excursion to a local city, and was making my way back to the car as dark clouds loomed overhead
I made it back and started for home as it started raining
Then there was a 'thunk' as something impacted with the windscreen
And another
It was hail
And in the middle of summer here!  Hence it was an odd experience, driving in the summer, with the car heaters on to prevent condensation and the windows wound up
most unpleasant
More pleasant was the continuation of  Armor
After a shaky start I realised that the non-stop writing style conveyed the madness of the story very eloquently
And it does have chapters
just 70+ page ones
More out of curiosity, I picked up the  Lone Wolf Roleplaying Game  today, along with a second hand copy of  GURPS Fantasy Adventures
The LWRPG seems interesting enough, and the authors have at least made the effort to separate it from d20 a little
I can't remember how much of the info is accurate though
Its been a while since I read the Lone Wolf books
The other book was cheaper, but the previous owner had seen fit to scrawl notes over some parts of the original text, which I found incredibly annoying
I also got Forever Peace and Forever Free, so today has been quite an expensive one
In other news, my other campaign didn't run
so the previous week was not a good week for roleplaying :(
No school tomorrow!! I'm so happy there is none tomorrow
I will spend the whole day watching movies, going on the computer and internet, etc
Bo Tulaney Tulaney tiki tanga Matu matu ma'a'ta Abu abu ala way, hey!   That's the Fijian war chant
I love it, and you should learn to love it
James Brown is the man by the way
I want to see his show
I want to see the cape
I want to see where it started
I don't want to be let down
But, I've resolved to go crazy
Not in a bad way, or in a compulsive way, but just
insane
This meg thing is wearing on my mind, and I'll get it all out there, but I know that in the end, things will be fine
So, I'll do what I can, do what I want, and go crazy
The craziness will not involve her, per say, but only my crazy ideas and the matriculation of them
Sounds good, eh?  But see, if I wrote down some really good stuff
or typed it
I could paste it on my walls, with wallpaper paste, and it has the possibility of looking really cool
What would be even better and not as self-absorbed is if I just had people write on the walls in one room of my imaginary house/apartment
Like this biker bar in Arizona called Greasewood Flat
But see, I'd make sure they had something brilliant to write
With this blogger I can change time, or stop time
So what does that mean for you? I'm going to transcribe or find a score or convince lauff that we need to play 'I love you more than you'll ever know' by Blood Sweat and Tears
It's soo great
I wish I had a good voice, because I'd sing this every night if I could
Cape or no cape, I'd do it
As of now, I've run dry
so now that i have a moment, let me tell you about this past weekend
as i said before, it was wonderful
Su and i spent all of the time up there together, holding each other, cuddling, and, after our first kiss friday night, kissing
and let me tell you, that first kiss was worth the wait
it was great
the cabin was great and we even got a few inches of snow fall saturday night, waking up to this:    urlLink      that's her gti
we talked a ton, worked out a lot of the specifics as to what we are as relationships go
seems that we are moving a lot faster than she has ever done before with a guy and that she gets anxious about commitment and labels and how friends and people in public view her in new relationships
she confessed that it takes her a long time to be comfortable in public with a new guy and to finally start using the 'boyfriend'/'girlfriend' labels but that she is a one guy type of gal which made me feel better about us not having a label yet
for perspective, she told me that of the guys she's dated, she didn't kiss them for the first time until almost a year or more had passed and with me things are falling into place a lot quicker than she's use to
she did say that once she does feel comfortable and the initial anxiety goes away that she's a very affectionate person in public and lavishes her beau with tons of attention
it just takes her time to get to that point
but when we're alone, she's more free to do what her heart wants without her brain getting in the way
i told her that its ok with me and that while i might possibly would want it another way, i'm can be more than content to do it her way because she means that much to me
she's was very happy that i was so understanding and went out of her way to show me
this weekend was blissful, waking up next to her both mornings was a wonderful feeling
falling asleep next to her at night, so comfortable
she told me she felt the same way
i really really like where this whole thing is going and can't wait for the next step
she's been on my mind all morning, i'm looking forward to the next time i get to see her
its not nearly soon enough
lol, i dont know how i got around to thinking about this
but like
things you wouldn't shoot with a gun, you might still be able to shoot with a camera
people, animals, yeah
WEIRD i know
but since no ones probly gonna see this anyways, its ok, ill just weird myself out
sarah, youre so weird, so weird, you should be shot with a camera! it'd probly break though
it would be like, ahhhh, nooo, too weird, must self-destruct! yeah, ok
urlLink    here i am singing
&nbsp; urlLink
i must say
you are the best dancer
AAAARGH!!  Just found out the paper is due in 2 days, and not 3 as I thought
it's Tuesday already
So the damned thing is due
TOMORROW
Shit shit shit
I'm still researching, can u believe that? I'm almost done, though
Thank goodness! After this I'm going to arrange the facts and type it straight away
I don't expect much sleep tonight
I was  sooo  hoping on going to the lake and do a bit of running in the morning =(    Today:  Sent my sister to uni, researched paper, slept for a bit and had dinner at the Hyatt
Now stuck with shitload of werk
Well, gotta run
Hmmmzz it seems like I'll have to grow up soon
or I may regret not doing so now in e future
urlLink     Dangeresque!
The following is  urlLink Tonino's , review of the  urlLink EXCALIBUR Hotel  in Las Vegas, Nevada
He gave his opinion after he got back from his honeymoon and one of the excalibur's cleaning member stole his new  urlLink Nikes
Read On
The cleaning lady STOLE my new Nikes!!!! On my HONEYMOON
Oct 24 '03  Author's Product Rating One Star  Pros NONE  Cons They ruined my honeymoon and did'nt fix the problem right then and there
The Bottom Line Don't stay at this or any of there sister hotels cause the cleaning lady stole my shoes from a closed suitcase
Full Review  I was there for 5 days and 4 nights for my Honeymoon
The first day was ok
The next day they 'forgot' to give us new towels
The 3rd day they left the dresser dirty and aparently opened one of the drawers next to the bed cause it was left open
The 4th day they didn't vacuum the room
The last day the cleaning lady STOLE my sneakers from a closed luggage case
I'm sorry, they disappeared I guess
So I went off about how them going through my stuff ruined my honeymoon
They told me they had to investigate
BTW, the Sat cost $145 for the night
Now I wasn't paying for that
Also, Guest Relations is closed on Sat and Sun
WOW, that just blew my mind
The front desk was not helpful at all
Never did they appologize for my problems at THERE hotel
Well, they 'found' my sneakers 2 days later
Apparently they were 'turned in' to Bell area
I guess they just walked themselves there
or the cleaning ladies son doesn't wear 9 1/2
They told me they would look into my 'request' to not pay for the Sat night
Yeah sure
They call me back and say my 'request was denied'
DENIED??? Well that was unacceptable
I ended up talking to the Guest Relations boss and he says they are going to reimburse me for one of my days
The other days cost $55 a night
I told him again that I wasn't paying for the $145 night cause that was the day it happened
He said he had to look into it and they would send back a check to me
Discover card was already called to dispute the charge until I get a check for $145 plus taxes
Amazing
I travel all over to FL, CA, GA, MN
and never had anything stolen
They should have fixed this problem when it started and I wouldn't be writing this letter today for the world to read
DON'T STAY AT THE EXCALIBUR, OR THERE SISTER HOTELS, LUXOR, MANDELAY BAY
They own others so look them up and don't stay at those either
PS: If you would like to give your opinion do so at  urlLink this blog  or if you want further publicity you should voice it out at  urlLink epinions
Okay, I have a website I want you guys to have a look at
My cousin referred me to it two years ago
Which cousin? Oh, the Clay Aiken look-alike one
Except my cousin doesnt look like a geek at all
It's called  urlLink Happy Tree Friends
Don't be fooled by its name
It's not lame AT ALL
It's pretty disgusting, if you ask me
I'm not kidding on this part
All those with weak hearts had better not view the website
It might give you bad dreams for like, a month
Look what happened to me
I avoided it altogether for two years
WARNING: IT'S DISGUSTING
THOSE WHO FAINT AT THE SIGHT OF BLOOD, EVEN CARTOON ONES, BETTER NOT VISIT
Yeah, and has there ever been such a scandal-ridden administration?  Maybe that was the reason
The only less qualified candidate I can think of is LBJ
I think that Eisenhower should be on the fifty
He was a good guy, and as far as I know he doesn't have a bill or coin
But I may be wrong on that
Victor: If there is one guy who truly likes u, will u accept him? Victor: U look so pretty & behave cutely, got any guys go after u b4? Victor: U reali like sleeping beauty man
Victor: Tmr I go to the shop find u
Victor: Do u mind go star-gazing wif me?  etc
Victor is a guy I knew at work
Though he same year as me, his thinking & behavior still dat kind of playful & havent-grown-up type
I dunno wat his msg means la
But I noe I treat him as frd only
if I agree to go out eat dinner wif him
it is only a friendly gesture
Hope he didnt think too much
always 'buai gam' wif our supervisor & colleagues
He likes to talk back
as his frd
I dunno how to help him
I got say him
but he say I'm naggy like his mum
Lolx! Maybe I'm sensitive la
thinking of Alex once in awhile
Izzit I reali like him le? I cant explain the feeling
I cant even say y I like him
maybe he gave me the brotherly feeling
I used to wish for an elder bro
Some of my frds say they cant stand their bro and all
Maybe it's my female hormones doing sth to me
Haha! Maybe I juz crave for the protected feeling
Willy is doing an ok job
at being my FAKE BRO
not bad la
Got him such a bro
Since he oso wan a sibling
and I wan an elder bro
JUZ NICE LOR
No more feelings for him
I knew
deep down in my heart
Now there's tis peacefulness in me now
I treasure it
and I dun wish to ruin in near future
I gotta prepare liao
Gg Toa Payoh to eat dinner wif tis boy boy (Victor)
HAHAHAHAH
if he noez wat I wrote in here
he'll kill me man! Lol
ciaoz!
I'll try to make this a staple in my blog, just a mindless post of whatever's on my mind
- Am I the only person in Puerto Rico who hasn't seen  Shrek 2  this past week? I went this past Saturday at 3:00 PM, only to find out all the tickets were sold out in all three theaters until  11:00 PM ! Maybe I'll be lucky and be able to check it out this weekend during the daytime
- I finally cracked and bought myself a Nintendo Gamecube
I swore off gaming consoles when I souped up my PC and got the latest titles that couldn't compare to whatever the PSI, xebec or Gamecube was offering
But after playing games like  Super Mario Sunshine, Mario Kart: Double Dash, and The Legend of Zelda , I couldn't resist buying it, especially in these lonely and boring times alone in my apartment
Metroid Prime   is one of the best games ever!  - There's a lot of commotion going in the Linux and Open-Source world
I personally love Linux and use it for most of my daily tasks (except gaming, the one gigantic hole Linux has yet to seal)
I really don't care who wrote the Linux code, if it was stolen from Unix or Minix or any other *nix
They should focus on making it better, and let's see if Linux can finally take off on the desktop like analysts (whoever they are) have been telling for several years
That's about all I have now, let me get back to work before I'm fired! :)
Ok I know ya'll want to read more about me, so here it is! haha

urlLink    Great landing!&nbsp; urlLink
ooo herro thats hello actually well wat is up?!!? hmmm  umm I am very shmery bored and it is very bad fro my phycologcal (never understood why is spelled like that) state well byebyes 4 now xx good idea for the sleep over thing
Yay! Comstocks have returned! Indianapolis just hasn't been the same
Journalcon was fun
Erin, if you read this in time, please bring the tapes to youth group so they can listen to a bit of the madness
The new template fits my current mood perfectly
This research paper is driving me mad! I'm about half-way done with it, but I have a real headache, and have taken two naps because of it
It's like pulling teeth out of my ears
I am generally Goshenellumpth
Oh well
Back to work
It's time to bring this ship into the shore, and throw away the oar forever
I am blogging here tonight on the request of andy, because we both know that nobody else would blog tonight and so i had to strain brain cells (surprise
i do have them) to think of a topic to blog about
I have chosen to blog about auto pilot
Auto pilot is cool because it gives the impression that i'm doing something when mentally i'm not
Here's an example, for those who don't know i play the piano, and after a while my fingers know all the notes
This allows my mind to kinda wander away for the hours that i practise while letting anyone who walks by see that i'm playing properly
Another good example is swimming
During my weekly 4km swim, my mind drifts away while my arms and legs continue to stroke
Auto pilot is also good indication whether something is boring or not
I do not enjoy swimming or playing the piano because it's boring so i have autopilot
I have not yet come across any other activities that have autopilot yet but if any of you guys have an auto pilot for something tell me
I just want to see the wide range of activities that have them
So on Friday night I was totally, and completely tired
As I'm getting in bed, my cellphone rings
I answer it and ofcourse some guy is pranking me saying things like he's been in love with me for forever and that he wants to go on a date to the arcade with me and a bunch of really funny nonsense
He also claims that his bedtime is 9 oclock and that he wants to marry me
In the backround i hear people saying ' ask her what she's wearing' and giggling
What goes around comes around? EH? I always prank call people
SO whoever called me, thanks for cracking me up
Good JOb
So I fell asleep at around 10/11?? Woke back up at 12 the next day
I think I had the best sleep of my LIFE! I went to La Reina's graduation, it was shorter and less painful than i imagined it to be
Then, I went to The Cheesecake Factory and stuffed myself with food until I couldn't BREATHE
Got home, and instead of making plans with my friends
I decided to be cool and color with Adam
So I spent an hour and half coloring out of a Spiderman coloring book
Should I even be putting this in here? Not that you guys don't think I'm a big enough loser
I have to get out of the house and do something fun soon, hey somebody, anybody call me up
no suprise that phil of the future is growing on u
that's silly
i wanna see that show!!! ne ways
i guess it's a good thing that u missed ur wisdom teeth thing
?? i'm soo excited!! the thought of going home to my cell fone and calling people makes me so happy! lol
i'm such a nerd
my thumb is bitten on the left hand so i can't write and typing hurts like a lot
poooppp
man! i'm watching the greatest tv show in the world!! it's in korean though
but i'm understanding a lot of it! and the guy's really really hot
whoo hoo!!! and this is a funny show
ne ways! 19 days until i go home!!!! i'm soo happy! ewlps
i g2g now
i had a ross-inspired dream once
it ended with jets firing rockets past skyscrapers into this enormous pair of legs that was terrorising tokyo
i finally found  urlLink yoav's purpose
i stopped playing kevinisation at half ten last night, and managed to get to bed on time
and then i had a phone call at about 12
it was a cheerful greek, who said 'i fell asleep on the tube and i'm stuck in seven sisters
i can't get back to balham
can i come and stay at yours?'
i said yes
then there was another call a minute later: 'do you know any taxi numbers? there's only one driver here and he's a mentalist who doesn't know where camden is'
i gave him the only taxi number i know
then another call: 'the taxi number's no good, there's no-one this side of london
none of the bus drivers knows which bus i need
help!'
i gave him the number for the transport helpline
45am, i had a bambos on my doorstep
this morning, i mostly want to die
hehe, man you guys Rock!! (and I hope you don't roll)
Nonetheless, yesterday night I was doing my computer assignement for 6hours and 15min
NOT kidding
I started at 5:55pm and finished at 12:10pm, 'non-stop'
I was in McGill and almost missed the last metro home
Yet, I did it!!! I frik'n did it, and it's only 1
5 page long and it works!!  Today, I have to do my mech-1 and cal-3 assign-s
Shoot me if it will take as much time
DREAMS   Lately, I have begun dreaming again
For awhile I had stopped dreaming, or at least I wasn't remembering my dreams
Then, I had a series of dreams about my friends, in bizarre situations, and suddenly I'm dreaming again
I have had dreams about being friends with Britney Spears, my current friends, owning a dog, going to Sundance
its crazy
I think that it comes from sleeping too much, because I will often wake up at exactly 8 hours after I went to sleep and then go back to sleep
That's when I dream
I am not complaining- it keeps things interesting
But its odd
It kind of makes me want to buy one of those dreams interpreted books, and learn all about my psyche
then again, ignorance is bliss
There's a game out there, and the stakes are high, and the guy who runs it figures the averages all day long, and all night
once in a while he let's you steal a pot, but if you stay in the game long enough, you've got to lose, and once you've lost, there's no way back, no way at all
(the time has come)   Thanks for letting me guest host

Lord, cometh   From  urlLink Bourque  Newswatch: EXCLUSIVE: MARTIN LIBS FEAR LORD MOST LORD'S DISCIPLES He's the one candidate Martin Libs will privately admit they are concerned about
Bernard Lord
And yes, Lord cometh
With the NB Premier set to enter the race for the leadership of the Conservative Party, now stunning news about who he can count on to build the coast-to-coast campaign organization needed to wage a winning bid
And winning is what this bid is all about
According to highly placed sources, Lord will count on the 'hands-on' support of Alberta Premier Ralphl (sic) Klein, former PM Brian Mulroney, and no less than Jean Charest, the Liberal Premier of Quebec, and the former Conservative Deputy-Prime Minister of Canada
Lord, who mere weeks ago was denying an interest in the new Party's leadership, is now 'playing coy' this morning, according to a BN report out of Fredericton
Says Lord, 'a lot of things can change in life'
Meanwhile, top Liberal sources are admitting to Bourque that 'Lord is to one we have to watch, he can build the coalition that can trip us up'
Interesting that Bourque's sources in the Martin Libs are so candid with thier concern that  this guy  might 'trip up' thier chances
Time to start paying attention again
Sectionals  It was one really long weekend, but now that its all over i can finally say: NO MORE DAYS UNTIL THE END OF SWIMMING BECAUSE ITS ALL OVER!!!!  HELLO POLO!!!  Sorry, had to get that out
I swam ok this weekend
Not great, but ok
Went a 53
9 in the 100 fly and got yet another sectionals time (woohoo, i have 3 now), 2:01
2 in the 200 IM and added 2 seconds, 58
04 in the 100 backstroke and added a half second, and a 2:01
06 in the 200 fly and dropped 2 seconds
I also swam in the B medley relay when they converted the pool to long course and really sucked
I warmed up in the diving well, which is 25 yards, and then they started the relays and when we were up i jumped in to swim backstroke
I knew that it was going to be long, a lot longer than what i was used to, but i didnt know how long
The first 50 went alright, i got to the wall about when i expected to, but on the second 50 i couldnt figure out when the wall was going to get there
I kept saying to myself 'its coming, its coming', but it never did
So i picked my head up out of the water and tried to look behind me, and damn it! i was only halfway across the pool
Oh well, i got a lot of grief about that from my coach and the guys on my relay
Over all it was a good meet, when we werent swimming, we were playing halo
I got almost no sleep whatsoever because we had some late night head to head slayer games, i guess its surprising i did as well as i did
Annie Chandler  The greatest part of the weekend was Annie getting her Olympic Trials cut in the 100 breaststroke!  Yeah, the OLYMPIC TRIALS
Its really weird now, knowing that i train with an olympic trialist
But of all of the people i know, annie deserves it the most
She is a really hard worker, and she is just an all around great person
Congrats Annie!
Kendo practice wasn't that great
I was knackered when I got there after being stuck in traffic for two and a half hours in the sweltering heat with a busted A/C
Eventually I just had to stop, because I was so pissed off with everything
I didn't feel like I had the energy to fight back, and the more hits I took the more pissed off I got
I think that's the last time I will try and make it to a Friday practice; there's no point stressing about getting there when the traffic is so bad, only to be too tired to practice properly
I guess I'm not a shining example of how a kenshi should behave, but there was no way I could continue in the state I was in
Interesting
I tend to close channels of communication with some individuals based on less-than-adequate reasons
Everyone does this, I know
And when those abandoned parties unexpectedly reopen communications, it's equal parts shock, relief and guilt
Can you tell this recently happened to me??  So my advice to all those in this situation: experiencing an unexpected, yet welcome reestablishing of communication with an ex-wife, old friend or long-lost sister, I offer this advice
(Damn, how do you type a bullet on a Mac?)  1
Be honest
Did you misrepresent yourself before?  Well, now you've had some extra time to consider who you are
So show off your your newfound knowledge
be endless in a victory of yourself
Be explicit
Did you ask her to sleep with you before and she said no?  Fuck it, man
Ask her again
You can't hit the apple if you don't fire the arrow
And if you did hit it on the first try, you're just a damn good archer
Be grateful
People today don't value one another
stranger, friends and family alike
So rejoice (in a non-religious fashion) that the abandoned person values you enough to reopen that channel
That can't possibly be a bad thing!
Silly, Jon
:)  I was merely referring to your absence at Fusion this week
and last
It's an open invitation, of course
'Specially since you've been going longer than I
Then again, Fusion is for young adults, and
I guess you don't qualify
:)  Just kidding
You were missed
Here's your official invitation:  hang out with us
:)    Hey everyone:  Let's gang up on Jeff
He went and had himself a baby
What a traitor!  Just kidding, of course, Jeff
Rock on with that beautiful baby of yours
She's so stinkin' cute!

I have now compiled what I think are all of my diaries that I have been keeping at my mother's house
There's 16 books here and about another 15 that I have in Atlanta
I have been going through them randomly and am consistently surprised by how much I had forgotten
n I have also made a point to get a different looking diary each time
Some are big, some are narrow, some are plain and some are really fancy
It all depends on my mood
I have even been given blank books that I wound up never using because it didn't fit my mood at that time
(I always felt guilty for that) I find that the best diaries if they are about 81/2 x 6', with college rule, and either spiral bound or bound like an old book (in other words sewn, not glued)
If they're too big, they're cumbersome
If they're too small, they cramp your hand
A lot of people tell me they tried keeping a diary but didn't like it
My bet is they were just using a second-rate book
One of the diaries had a lock on it and I had to find one of those generic tiny lock keys to open it
Sure enough, being th good girl scout she is, my mom had one of those keys
I opened the book and found it was from 1994 from March to December
And then I remembered that I had locked it after the 'Cape Cod Condom' incident
In 1994 I moved back to the USA from Germany to live with my Aunt and Uncle in Indianapolis
That winter I spent two grueling days in a car with my mom's parents (Grandma and Grandpa F
)  to get to Cape Cod where my parents live for Christmas
Long story short: my Grandpa didn't fully shut the lid to his car trunk and all of my things got wet
I wasn't there for the ordeal and when I heard that they had gone through everything to lay it out to dry, I nearly had a heart attack
One of the items being hung out to dry was my DIARY
It was the one with a ripped condom wrapper taped in it with the words, 'I DID IT!!' written next to it
Naturally
I was sure that if anyone were to open the diary, it would naturally open to the 'marked' page, thus making my deflowerment known to my (eek!) Grandparents, who would in turn make a fuss to my mother about my sinful ways
I had to make a difficult decision
It would be another day before I would have my (wet) things returned to me
I had to assume they had seen it, but I couldn't have my mother finding out about this from them
So in a terrifying pre-emptive move, I sat her down and told my mom I had had sex and that Grandma F
probably knew it by now
Oddly, my mom was more pissed off that I had preserved the moment than the fact that the moment had happened
But it was still one of THE most embarrassing moments in my life
I later found out that my cousin Jenny had quickly decended upon my things and saved my diary from the prying eyes of 'the adults
' Eventhough it was too late to save face to my mom, Thank You
BTW: i think these posts are sloppy and misspelled
My mother's keyboard is in the least ergonomically friendly position EVER, so too bad
I just spellchecked my last post and the replacement suggestion for 'freakin'' was 'foreskin!'  nice
Sure it has some benefits, mostly economic
But this  urlLink sobering article  details the costs of globalization on the people and ecologies of the third world nations
More evidence that we are doomed
OK, what would you do if the world fell to the darkness? Well, that would be the first time that the whole world would join together and have a target as one
But I think I would spend all day long doing
If I have to go to hell, then I´d better justify that reason
Yesterday was the end of my work days with a party
By the way, my friend saved my day
I thought that a video was spoilt, but it turned out ok
BAD NEWS  I´m pissed with my father´s second wife
She´s a bitch and a motherfucker
This was the very first time I felt betrayed and made as fool out of me
She wants to kill my family
I´ve never thought I would hate someone as I hate her
God get this out of me
Let´s forget because her punishement is on the way, I believe it
I have to believe
After this, I´m through today :(
It is very, very quiet around here
No one is talking
Tommy went to bed last night without telling any of us good night
Just walked in the bed room and shut the door
I am getting worried about him
It is like yesterday he made some turning point from trying to giving up
I am going to try to talk to him tonight
I have thought about writing him a email and sending it to him
He hates it when I cry, and I know I can't have this talk with him and not have major tears
I feel like I need to reassure him that I love him, that I am determined to make it thru this rough patch, and that I need his help in getting thru
If only one of us is working on our marriage, it isn't going to make it
We both have to dig in and stand firm
How am I doing? Well, I am worried, but I also have the ultimate comforter with me
I know God is with me, I can feel him
Even though the conversation between Tommy and my mom terrified me , I felt calm
That scared me too
But I know God was keeping his hand on me, letting me know he is in control
I just have to be willing to accept whatever his will is
That is the hard part
I would never have dreamed in all my married life that I would be in this position today
You know they say that two in three marriages end in divorce
I would look couples I know, and say, well out of us three, we are the only ones who will make it
Why, because we  both had God in our marriage and in our lives
I know that God can take care of this, Tommy has to let him
Tommy has to be willing to give himself over to God
I just worry what it will take to get him to that point
Crap day at work yesterday, a number of meetings where I was the lone dissenting voice on the proposed plans
Also the proposed plans all seemed to be more work and in particular more for me
urlLink Asian News Channel International  reports: 'Belgian Christophe Brandt was the only cyclist to return a positive drug tests during the Tour de France, the International Cycling Union (IUC) said
'  That means that the Postie boys, including Lance tested clean, as promised
Armstrong claims that he is tested more than any of the other competitors in the Tour de France

They include  urlLink  Eraserhead  ,  urlLink  Dune  ,  urlLink  Blue Velvet  ,  urlLink  Wild at Heart  ,  urlLink  Twin Peaks  , and  urlLink  Lost Highway  , among others
There are a few more books than usual to consider, since, while in Portland, I visited the grand-daddy of used book stores, Powell's
Much joy, followed by much poverty, happened that trip
But, without further ado, here are some books that have caught my attention
and wallet
-- urlLink  The Road to Serfdom  , by F
Loved by libertarians and free market fetishists the world over, this lovely little volume discusses the dangers of collectivism versus individualism
Famously dedicated 'To Socialists of All Parties,' Hayek makes the case that individual changes and adapting to circumstances in the end creates more wealth and freedom than the collectivist option
While he makes some pretty good points, you can definitely see that his expertise is in economics (it's a trippy thing to see an idol of some libertarians advocating a federal world government, as Hayek does in his second to last chapter)
Worth a shot - always interesting
-- urlLink  The Conservative Mind  , by Russell Kirk
Yes, there is a reason why these two are on the list - I plan on doing an academic journal article on conservative political thought some time after getting the PhD, so getting the material now
Anyway, this book is credited for causing Hayek to give his 'Why I am Not a Conservative' speech - Kirk is arguing from a different angle, specifically giving a history of Burke-inspired (or -influenced) conservatism from Burke to Eliot
What has helped in reading it thus far is Kirk's writing style - he has a knack for broad phrases, poetry, and setting (it should be noted that, among other things, Kirk wrote various novels and ghost stories)
Should be quite interesting
--But, moving away from politics, now to the realm of 'SCIENCE!!!' (quick test - I bet you were raised in the 1980s if 'She Blinded Me With Science' gets stuck in your head after seeing 'science' with an exclamation point)
But, for we plebs who had to beg and plead to just pass basic chemistry, this is a different type of science reading
urlLink  The Road Since Structure   is a collection of articles written by MIT brainiac Thomas S
Kuhn, author of the paradigm-shifting book  urlLink  The Structure of Scientific Revolutions  , which introduced the idea of a scientific 'paradigm' and 'normal research' and the like, as well as the term 'paradigm-shift
'  So, be thankful
Yes, you
Anyway,  Road  is a collection of some of his articles following the publication of  Structure , attempting to clarify his views, while answering some of his critics
For philosophy of science geeks, this is uber-nifty
--And for those with an interest for the weird, I suggest  urlLink  A Life of Jung  , by Ronald Hayman
I must admit a personal interest in Prof
Jung - back in high school, we had one of those 'Meeting of the Minds' things we had to do for class
I wanted to be  urlLink Eliot Ness , but he was not enough of a mind for the thing (a few years later, some other student was that world-changing mental giant Jackie O
- not that I'm bitter or anything), so I ended up by chance picking one of the founders of modern psychology, Carl Gustav Jung
While he was about with Freud for a time, they (as I understand it) rather had a falling out
Words like 'collective unconscious,' 'archetypes,' and the like attach to Jung's name, a fellow also considered somewhat of a mystic (if not other things as well)
I've only read through a few of the first chapters in this book, and well
let me put it this way, if little Carl was about these days, we would say he was a child with 'issues
'  Jung was one seriously screwed up little kid (he would have his two 'personalities,' numbered One and Two; dreams that go from bizarre to blasphemous, etc
How long this stays with him, I don't know
But it is a little unnerving to realize that some of the big minds in psychology's founding were, well, in serious need of some therapy themselves (don't even get me started on Freud convincing a generation of scholars that they all wanted to sleep with dear ol' mom when they were three
But, looks like it could be an interesting look into the mind of someone who spent his time looking into the mind
--For those of you still reading (all two of you), a quick question
I've had this line stuck in my head, and I cannot recall who said it or when (though I wager it was either during the Mexican War or the Civil War)
It goes as follows (though note - it would be best to read it out loud, preferably with your best rendition of a South'n accen', as it will get the full effect): 'And there stands Jackson, like a stone wall
Let us vow to die here together then, and with it, gain victory
'  As I should be dissertating, I haven't the time to look for it right now
If anyone happens to be a nineteenth century US military history buff (or even one wearing a robe - I'm easy-going), please let me know who and where
Thanks!  --Huh
I know I wanted to mention at least one more book
But which one escapes me
Ah!  I know - try the  urlLink  Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies  , by Bartolome de Las Casas
Bishop Las Casas was an interesting man - serving in Chiapas during the first decades of the Spanish conquest of the New World, he unfailingly argued for the rights and dignity of the native peoples
My first run in with him was his strongest defense,  urlLink  In Defense of the Indians  , an extended argument/discussion/polemic on the issues at the time
As I understand it, Short Account is an abbreviated version of a history he did, with the purpose of illustrating to the King of Spain the horrors going on across the sea
While Las Casas has been co-opted by many (and, admittedly, I'm focusing on him for a chapter of my just war dissertation), he is still a fascinating man, and an interesting (if difficult) read
Well, time to dissertate again
Who knows?  I might actually get done in
oh, five or six years at this rate

I can't play chess when I'm tired
I went from an 800 rating this morning before work, to 730 after work
I need to be caffeinated up when I play
Actually I need to be caffeinated up for pretty much everything
everything that doesn't require me to be liquored up that is
Before work I dropped by Radio Shack to pick up a fuse for my FM transmitter, because I keep fucking up the settings and blowing the fuse
I ran into Ryan there, and after some chatting it was discovered that his girlfriend works at the Crossroads Diedrichs
I mentioned this to Anna, and she says she might know her
It's a small world here in The 'Vine
Now playing:  The Bouncing Souls  - Kids and Heroes  Yes The 'Vine is so small that it turns out that Abby lives a mere few minutes walking distance from Brandon

What a world it is we live in! Is this the best of all possible worlds? With all the progress we as species have made in art, science, and technology, we still let a large chunk of the population
Over a billion people on this planet are living on less than $1 a day
How many of these people are children who won't live into their teenage years due to starvation? How many of these children will be drafted into the military like in Uganda, or be trained to be suicide bombers like in the Middle East?

I'm outta here in 2 more days!  I want to say that this year has been so much of a better year than last year
Yea I've ranted and complained about stuff, and yes the world is still shitty due to American foreign policy
however, this year has been better in that I've found my groove, produced good work, and met extremely cool people
I'm looking forward to summer now
I will, however, have to get research done and a job
But I wonder if it's going to be anything like last summer
For reals, last summer was absolutely insane
Drunken parties, Vegas, concerts, concussions, molotov cocktails, punk rock midgets, The Schayer Impersonator, punching a ceiling, karaoke, vomit, drama, action, comedy
it's amazing no one got hospitalized or arrested
Let's get ready to rumble!  ***
I'm back, but not with much force I'm afraid
My vacation was barely a vacation
I saw everyone back home and froze my tail off
It even snowed a little one day
Anyway, I'm regrouping physically and mentally for a few days, but I'm keeping my ears open for news
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going back to sleep in the office supply closet
Please knock if you need something
yeah, so i get all my friends to be nosy on my life by reading my blog on a semi-daily basis and then i neglect to put in entries
i'll be lucky if i ever have a following again  = )  excuse #1 - i'm fuckin' crazy at work
i teach and teach and teach all freakin' day long and then when i DO get back to my desk, i'm explaining to people how to do stuff that i just taught them (i'm sick of people surfing and checkin' email instead of listening in my classes)  dammit!  excuse #2 - i don't have an internet connection at home
screw aol and any other isp out there, i'm not paying you ANYthing
excuse #3 - there's no way in HELL i'm coming back into work post 5pm simply to put blog postings out there to please my friends
i'll buy you a drink at 5-8 instead *grin*  ok
now that i got that off my chest i can go back to work
i promise more blogs in the future!!!  *smooches*
I just read a short article on yahoo
com that said blogging has yet to really take off
And, honestly, it might be for the best
Case in point: I spent the past hour or so trying to find every baseball blog that I could
And some of them were pretty good
But not that many
A lot were pretty similar, mostly focused around a single team, and a lot included statistical analysis, which is kind of boring to read about
So, long story short, there is a LOT of stuff being written about baseball out there, so I really need to stay on top of current events, but (at the same time) write about what appeals to me, because I simply can't compete with ESPN, BPro, or BPrimer
The one thing that I also noticed is that most of these other baseball blogs mainly talked about baseball
I mean, I love baseball, and I love talking about it, and analzying it, but I need a break from it every now and then (and the season hasn't started yet!)  So I'm definitely going to keep writing about life in general, and hopefully JT, Andy, and Barstool will too
I'm off
had a good weekend
of being with friends i mean
i didn't study at all [ bad me! :( ]  eduard went back to UK yesterday
so we had dinner and drinks last saturday
it was all his treat
josil,ina,froilan,debbie,tintin,kenneth,rolly,mizpah with bf eumer and me were the attendees
we had fun
and to think i was kinda the 'topic' of conversation especially last night
i  tried my best not to give in with their teasings and all
even if deep inside i was beginning to lose my temper
i just smiled and kept quiet most of the time
right!they know me so well that i won't get angry even with all their jokes
;p oh well!i'm still ok
i'm cool
The Road Not Taken  Robert Frost     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth;  Then took the other, as just as fair, And having perhaps the better claim, Because it was grassy and wanted wear; Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really about the same,  And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden black
Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back
I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I-- I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference

I forgot to mention yesterday about the whole Zach/Josh/Mel thing
I don't kow how, but its cute anyway
Mel and I were coming back from Hastings the other day and we see Josh and Zach out jogging together, now I love them both dearly, but they are far too pretty (esp
Zach since he grew his hair out
Then we saw CPD and I joked that we should stop the cop and tell him to arrest Josh and Zach, cuz they were far too pretty to be guys
See, cute, huh?  :0)  I also ran into the other Zach and talked to him a bit
He's working full time out at the winery and so he hasn't had a lot of time to hang out
Too bad he's fun to hang with
Also haven't talked to Monkey or ONeal lately
Wonder how they are?  O, ran into Mark today on the way to class and guess who hit the button for me?  Mark of course
He did and then looked at me and was like old habits die hard
And I was like thanks for calling me old, biatch
Funny moment of the morning there
GW still isn't working, damnit
I don't know why, it just isn't
Angel's on
AI was on a bit ago, but I didn't really watch it
I'm finding its not as great as it was
And I can't figure out why I had a thing for John Peter Lewis
I thought he was cute!?!?  Umm, ok
Call it a weak moment
Oh, well, its on to bigger better things
No class Friday
I'm not going to the primary 2morrow so I have like a 3 and a half day weekend
Heather and Rashaun are supposed to be in town this weekend for Alumni weekend and Heather's supposed to bring Katari
Speaking of which I need to email her
I was going to have a Dennis Quaid movie marathon today, with Frequency and Cold Creek Manor and Far from Heaven if I had time
But I fell asleep right after lunch and woke up at 5 or so
So I only watched Shaft
Not a Dennis Quaid movie, but classic nonetheless
Let's see its baseball season
Haven't picked my teams yet, but of course the Astros on the list, just cause they're my hometown team
Other than that I haven't got any favorites at the moment
Depends on what other teams have guys with the best butts I suppose
hehehe
I'm soo bad, but I'm sooo good at it!  :)  Sweet, Knight Rider reference on Angel
Hehehe
Not much else going on here
Laters!
Ahh I feel I must write some useless crap that no-one really gives a toss about
Here goes
Leyles and myself have decided we are going to get stringer more involved ion the goings on in Littlehamptoin so we are going to invite him out more and more! huzzaa
Anyway it has reached my attention after browsing through lauren, stirngers and helens blogs, how sad, that there is a brawl in action
Naturally i wish to get myself involved and spread infamy and bewitchment to all unfortunate enough to read my ramblings

Nothing really happened today
I felt kinda sick earlier, but I feel better now
I made a new quiz, so take it
urlLink Take this darn quiz!
Heidi and I broke up today
&nbsp; Surprise, huh? &nbsp; I'm alright, though
&nbsp; I'm disappointed
and frustrated
and sad
&nbsp; But I'm ok
&nbsp; And it's almost as though a burden's been lifted
&nbsp; Details later
&nbsp; I'm too exhausted to talk about it now
The greatest trick I ever learned in dealing with someone you're sleeping with alot and you really like him/her, but you're not quite sure if him/her likes you the same way is to mouth the words 'olive oil'
If that person says 'I love you too', then you're in
If that person has a shocked look on his/her face, then you say, 'Olive oil, baby
Let's get the olive oil
'  (I know that's an old one, but that's all I could come up with and I felt like posting something)
Okay, I feel bad as to the reason for this post
But does anybody have an invite to join Google's gmail e-mail service that they don't want?    :-(   Yes, I'm a bad person
sloth! i lyk that
just like in the ice age!!
The Michael Jackson case doesn't look to be a solid as prosecutors are making it out to be
It looks like these  urlLink same allegations  have been previously investigated and dismissed by child welfare authorities before:   Both the boy and his brother told investigators Jackson had not sexually abused them, according to the memo
Their older sister said she had never witnessed anything sexually inappropriate between her brothers and the entertainer
And this:   The boy's mother told investigators in February that 'she believed the media had taken everything out of context,' the memo said
The mother said that the children were never left alone with Jackson and that her son slept in the same room with Jackson but never shared his bed
She said Jackson would sleep on the floor
I wonder what the mother's excuse will be for those statements?  This case is starting to get sad
I mean, this poor boy is apparently dying of cancer
Apparently his condition is quite bad
And Michael Jackson's life and reputation has been forever destroyed
And the truth is, nobody knows what really happened
Maybe Jackson did do something, and was able to convince the family to overlook it for a while
Or maybe nothing happened, and the family is now exaggerating things to get back at him
Only two people know for sure what happened - Jackson and the boy
Jackson tells his side (and nobody believes him)
The boy cannot tell his side, since he is protected (and rightly so) by our system of justice
The mother can tell her side, but her story is full of holes
So what's this all about?
heinz post   catchup posts are fun!  well it is sortof a catchup post, not a whole lot has happend siince my last post
on saturday i went to troy
lots of naked brad pitt
it was an ok movie, but im not into those sorta action/history movies
i didn't think gladiator was very good either so meh whatever
anyway, troy had lots of cool fight scenes
lots of lame other scenes too
work was sucky tongight
not that it was busy or annoying or anything, but i was tired and hungry and hot the whole time
not to mention that i just gernaly didn't want to be there
i wanted to be here playing puzzle pirates
speaking of puzzle pirates, that is why i have not posted in a while
and for those wondering, the reason my last post was like 4, it was coz blogger was being stupid and pretending not to work when it really was
Because I'd never forget such things - Happy Birthday  urlLink Adam ! Welcome to the sunset side of your 20's
The banana, possibly the world's most phallic fruit, hasn't had sex in years and  urlLink is in danger of extinction
That's too weird
AMAR ON JUSTICE  I thought I would post some things I posted on Austin Tice's blog in our discussion abouot the nature of justice
Austin, to paraphrase, asked what is justice and why is it necessary
Here is how I understand justice, which I learned at Georgetown:   Part I:  Justice has to do with our proper relation to others
It is necessary for our happiness
The person without justice-- the tyrant-- cannot have friends for there can be nothing otuside himself
Men always pursue justice because as human beings we know that justice is good for its own sake, for surely it is impossible not to hope that nothing bad ever happends to a good man
Austin says, ' In Response to Amar: What is justice, what is happiness, why is the former necessary for the latter, what makes a good man, etc
Moreover I can think of many instances when I would want something bad to happen to an allegedly 'good' man: if I wanted his wife, for example off the top of my head
'   PART II:   The only happy man is the good man, who has courage, prudence, temperence, justice, and other virtues (minor virtues like beauty, intelligence, and money all contribute but are not necessary for happiness), which are attained by performing acts which put them into existence
It is not possible to be happy if you are without the virtue; i
if you are cowardly
Justice is necessary for happiness because the person without justice is a tyrant, who besides having a disordered soul (which you, Mr
Tice, may very well best understand using Aristotlian Ayn Rand's definition)
Justice has been related to politics ever since the best city-- Athens-- killed the best man-- Socrates; why did the best city kill the best man and could this happen again? Ensuring that bad things do not happen to good men-- and indeed creating countries which would allow good men to exist, is the basis of politics  With respect to your example about wanting to sleep with another man's wife, I would say that you would not want to perform the act in order to hurt the man; in fact, you would probably wish to avoid hurting the good man
Rather, you would be performing the act in order to attain the minor virtue pleasure; if doing this is unjust, then you are disordered because you placed a minor virtue over a major virtue by placing pleasure over justice
Imprisoned
Oklahoma for Spring Break
::gunshot::  Everyone: I hope you have a great Spring Break and get lots of tan and be safe and for god's sake get throwed
Love, Bre
Cory, I hope you are reading this because otherwise only everyone else will be reading it and it will have done no such good
At any rate, I am leaving for Oklahoma either Tuesday evening or Wednesday morning
My {nazi parol-officer} mother says you can come over before we leave
So I am hoping you will be back from Padre on Monday rather than Tuesday
This would make things golden, golden indeed
I love you and I hope I get to see you before 10 days from now when I return from {hell} Oklahoma
Sincerely, Your girlfriend
Well apparently when I sent him a confirmation email it was going silly
I'm guessing it's just him not paying attention
All will be revealed in Part 2:  The truth of Penman's problem!
yes darth there are a lot of cars on the road now
what is up with that
it is taking me so much longer to get to work now, not that i'm in any rush to get there
i'm just saying
hey darth sorry about the mix up this evening
i'm a loser and rude hence my imood
i didn't vote today
so i can't say anything, i really wanted to though
(sigh)  man hedwig sorry to hear about med
school, i always found it funny when people said oh doctors make all this money and blah blah blah
i mean think about the amount of work that goes into being a doctor and it's not like you have all this time to spend money or even make that much
eh go figure
nothing much to really talk about
you see strange movies nick and you and lisa are SERIOUSLY SICK for going to the bridal expo
and actually having fun, what is wrong with you
hey dorkus please tell me all the good reel beet stories when you get a chance, i bet they are all classic
this post was for sunday:  i went and saw me some saves the day  - aside from being WAY TOO OLD for these shows, std gave a good performance, i liked how they played a pixies song which none of the kids there even knew who the pixies were
ha ha classic, seriously
personally i don't think it was as solid as it could have been, a lot of stuff from their older albums
and what is up with chris (the lead singer) and his new look, a hanson hair cut with nerd glasses and we are not talking the typical emo kind then there was his strange dancing
the other three bands were not so great, ash was the best of the three but even they were pushing it
although they did bust out jack names the planets and kung fu from the angus soundtrack
one highlight from their show was their cover of a weezer song, pretty sweet
music to my ears:  love will come through - travis :o)
You are prolly asking yourself what my finger has to do with my upstairs neighbour
the answer is nothing!  I think my upstairs neighbour is kind of creepy
He really weirds me out and I avoid him at all costs
I jammed my finger in the door at work yesterday and I have this really big ugly bruise and I think I may have sprained it
:(  Poor me!  Yay!  I'm off tomorrow
Tomorrow is my nephew's 2nd birthday!  Well, that's all I have to share
Goodnight :)
Yeah, the bond fan has loads of kurosawa, including both those, but has thus far only lent me The Seven Samurai
I might steal Ikiru pretty shortly, though
Sometimes, life grabs you by the ankles and pulls, and dammit if you're able to break the fall or not
Ehh, I've been generally happy for the past year, but i don't know
Sometimes i forget to smile and laugh
Sometimes I forget to cry
I feel like my highs are not so high, and my lows are not so low
I guess i'm slipping away from reality
I don't know if i feel anything anymore
urlLink    See this man
He doesn't look that dangerous
In the picture to the left, he looks like a homeless bum
But the picture on the right is the real Saddam
And when I see anarchy by Iraqi people in Baghdad, I really don't think we shoud turn him over anytime soon

So long since I last posted something, and so much has happened
(for those of you who care
I have  not  managed to get a life yet, although the nice lady at the mental hospital said I could have a bed in about 6 months) I suppose I  could  fill you in
but that would be too much bother
awww who am I kidding, its not like I have anything else to do
*sigh* Here goes
First of all, I've got a girlfriend
and before the multitudes out there think its the end of the world
I don't know how either
so don't ask me
(that includes you phil :P )  Second of all
I'm in Canada, or Canadia depending on your sexual orientation
staying with my aunt
and a 2 year old cousin who  will not stop following me  > :| )  Bah
(no phil
you cannot ask questions

If you direct your attention to the chat box, McCall says his brain hurts
Now since that's all there is to go on I'll just have ot assume that he's on drugs

Busy weekend
Dale and I had a date nite and went to  urlLink Sticks & Stones  in Brookfield on Friday night
It was very very tasty-very
Then we went to look at cars
We are going to test drive a  urlLink Subaru Legacy Wagon  at the Acura dealership Tonight
It's pretty sweet, and darker blue, and stick (thank god)!   Saturday spent time with Dan who is here from Texas, was at Jeffs then went to the Pond to cook out and swim and play a crazy game of bocci (which turned into Sand Bocci and toss the ball 7000 feet bocci thanks to Muench)
Sunday we gamed here at our place and ate Yummy food from the deli (thanks mikey)
Now this week I (Thankfully) have very little to do, no doctors appointments, no baseball games, and all I need to do is head into the office on Friday to go to a 1 hour meeting (and lets hope I feel shitty enough to just call in for it!)   Sprechen of that, I actually feel pretty crappy
Have a cold (gotta be from the pond), Im achy pretty much everywhere from the waste down (except my back doesnt hurt, go figure?)  My boss is gone all week in CT so I'm not sure how much real work (new) I will get this week, looks like another week of updating the manual for training, yippie skippy!
Has been hectic at work this past couple of days
It must be the pipework, because all of a sudden I'm channelling Naomi Tyack with alarming accuracy
I'm fucking up about once every two seconds, I know nothing about what I'm doing and I can see those around me rapidly losing patience
I'm not quite up to Tyack's high standards yet -- I've thus far avoided using 48 point font in any of my calculations, and haven't handed anyone a map for a task, blissfully unaware of the canal that crosses the length of the map and that will make the task impossible to complete -- but I feel myself getting close
And you know the funny thing?  I'm going to be on this until August at least
Tried to get some reviewing done this last couple of nights, but I seem to be failing badly
Two nights on one submission and I'm only halfway through
Needless to say I haven't got any writing done either
What have I been doing?  Certainly not going out, and there's been nothing on the telly to adequately distract me
Puzzling
Utter darkness
Senses acute with the absence of sight
I can hear the soft pitter-patter of mice feet running across the stone floor at night
Sometimes I'm lucky enough to have their sharp claws digging into my flesh
The wounds still hurt
My button has become my best friend
Sometimes I squeeze it so hard I bleed
The pain is like a sudden rush for me
The adrenaline pumping through my veins
And then it's gone and I'm alone again
Sometimes I dream of her to make me happy when Ben doesn't work
She was beautiful
A living Aphrodite
But then they come in
They tighten the bonds even more so I can't slip my skinny hand through
I can never see their faces
I tried talking to them once but they said nothing
They are the other people I see in my dreams
I see her, Jesus, and them with mouths bound together with leather stitches
But even Jesus has no purpose here
She sometimes works but despite her everlasting beauty I still suffer
I do not know what to enscribe here
Nothing is occurring in my life that could be construed as anything remotely resembling fascinating
Which makes me rather sad
Today, my dad and I drove in the car, van, whatever, to experience the delight that is  urlLink Good Bye, Lenin!'
and once again, my mother kicks me off the computer, just as i was on a roll, writing something
hey you, you know you should probably add more to your page than pictures
i know you are busy sometimes but you should really post your thoughts so we know how you feel
take care lil girl and see you later
Just to let u know, that last post was just creative writing
But it did contain some truth
Here's what is real
I have come to a decision that can change my life
I have to choose between two poeple, and I can't choose
I can't stand making one person sad
The 3rd choice is that I choose no 1 for now
Anyways I am still sick, and i think i'm getting worse
Damn common cold
Why can't we cure it?
A list of things that I have seen in the past few days that I really liked:   urlLink Red Sox Nation Raises Terror Alert to Red   urlLink Viagra Test Drive   urlLink Top Amazon

(hilarious and kind of a frightening at my future at the same time)
Hey every1 I just came back from reading  urlLink Tiffany's  Blog and it is madd funnii lol she's the best

lmao how many times has tamrah thrown away her money? Way to many to count lol! Omg its a miracle marissa remembered her purse lol   Any way in English class that was madd fun when we were supposed to be reading we all were passing notes and marissa was stupid enough to pass her money I can't believe tamrah gave it back to her lol
In science it smelt soooooooooo bad like fish in there and we looked at the table and there was a note and it said Ryan I told you to keep your legs closed!! eewww --- turns out there was an octopus in the sink or what ever and I had to help clean up a sink I'll tell you rubbing alcohol and fish don't smell good at all I like gagged to death omg how could Ms marioenze deal with that smell all day!   Well I have nothing else to write so come back lata bye
Hopefully, all of the creative types I know will relate to  urlLink Bradford's  post

NOSEY SWIMMERS   It appears that sperm just love the scents at Crabtree & Evelyn
Lily of the Valley helps chances of conceiving?  I'm just wondering how a girl puts it on without getting a  major  infection
wow, driving around Houston this morning was a trip! Cars were scattered everywhere like carnage from left behind (who would have guessed I'd have cause to reference that tripe two days running?)
They must have flooded out in the streets, then tossed around in the water
This morning, with the water receded, it all just looks surreal
The bayous are still up street to street, but at least not over the street in most places
Where they did go over the streets, mud bars now scar across the lanes
If you read my post from last night, you know how overplayed I thought the whole flood was, but the scenes today are enough to inspire me to retract
The traffic was crazy on every street this morning, and I couldn't figure out why, then I realized that I10 must still be flooded, or too littered with flooded out cars to be passable
It was an absolute river yesterday
But the important thing is how bright and clear the sky is
Yesterday, as all this rain started to move in, I remember thinking how pretty and vibrant the colors all seemed
Wet and sleek, bright against the gray of rain and clouds
Stoplights, headlights, crossing guard lights all captured my eye
And then I woke up and saw the sunlight this morning
Sun never looked so good!    UPDATE: I've discovered that after a natural disaster that attacked cars in the city whose blood runs black, Houston quickly begins to look like a real city
The busses were clogged, the sidewalks were busy, the bikelanes were downright crowded! Good old Mama Nature took a popshot at Tom DeLay!
I have a dream to live comfortable and to have some toys
I want a life that I don't have to worry about money
I want to live the easy life, when I need something I can just go get it, nothing to big like a car
Just the little things, like if my kids want a big swimming pool I can get it and it won't matter how big it is
I want to move out of the trailer court and have a pretty big house not to big, I don't like to clean a big house just enough rooms so the kids have big bedrooms and when my step-daughter comes over for the weekend she has her own room and doesn't have to share with my daughter
I want to travel some day, and right now money is stopping us and if I get a good paying job, then my husband can slow down and be able to spend more time with us
He can have a couple days off or even vacation time, so that we can go out and play like a family should when theres enough money
I want to be setting really good
I kind of now in some ways, but in other ways we don't, we sometimes live pay check to pay check and I don't want to live that way any more
If my husband got hurt and couldn't work for awhile I might have to quit school and get a job
I want to have enough money so if he did get hurt then we don't have to worry and maybe I can work at home, so I can take care of him
It's almost time to close this place up
&nbsp; On top of that I've been having a swell day
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nobody complained
&nbsp; LOL
&nbsp; No backackes, and talk of 'mucus in one's chest
'&nbsp;&nbsp; LOL
&nbsp; Praise the Lord
&nbsp; Nobody knows how annoying and digusting it is to hear that mess, in addition to all the camel noises&nbsp;this co-worker makes
&nbsp; I've  never  met any woman who was willing to belckh or fart in front of other people
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;   The Ball and Mirror project didn't go so well
&nbsp; it looks like crap to me
&nbsp; I suppose that's my own fault for waiting so late
&nbsp; next time I'll have to do much better
&nbsp; I have two projects left in my Illustrator
&nbsp; Don't you know my animation project file got corrupted, again!&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm so pissed
&nbsp; I worked on that sucker
&nbsp; I wanted it to shine!&nbsp; This time around I made multiple copies, so if something went wrong, I had another back-up
&nbsp; Good thing too
&nbsp; I would have lost my mind as a few weeks of work goes down the toilet
&nbsp; A classmate of mine lost  ALL  of her current work
&nbsp; it wasn't pretty
I have a final presnetation
&nbsp; I'm doing it on American Realist Thomas Eakins
&nbsp; Eakins broke rules and conventions
&nbsp; Also I know a lot about his work
&nbsp; it makes the research much more easier, as I sort and tease through the information

&nbsp; Lord I'd be so regretting it now

urlLink The Friday Five :  1
Is your hair naturally curly, wavy, or straight? Long or short?  Long and straight and THICK  2
How has your hair changed over your lifetime?  Lengths and colors have changed, but that's all me
It was super curly when I was born, but that went away after my first haircut
It was even black once, but that was NOT voluntary
How do your normally wear your hair?  It's normally down until the early afternoon, at which time I pull it back cos it's finally dry and it's starting to annoy me
If you could change your hair this minute, what would it look like?  BLUE and even thicker and wicked sexy  5
Ever had a hair disaster? What happened?  My roommate helped me dye my hair my sophomore year of college
She had really short hair and was used to just dyeing the roots
I had really long hair
Do you see the problem?  I had a red ring on my head
It was awful
I wore a hat until my other friend could fix it
Today will be a long day
We had a staff meeting from 7-8, then I went home and napped for an hour, coming back at 9:30 to work til 7
At least I feel more human than when I came in before
Mmm nap
How random
Nick's online
Wow, cool
Yeah, it's my grandad's birthday tomorrow
Very cool
I'm bored
*yawn*
I've gone ahead and done it
Out of respect for your rights not to have your e-mail inboxes deluged with my rapid-fire political rants, useless attachments or fun photo-shopped images of whomever, I have opted to start this here blog
Lettuce start by saying I have no fucking idea how this thing is going to work
It could last a day, a month or for as long as I can draw a breath and my nubby, gnarled claws can still type obsceneties and expletives on the keyboard
Consider this a test post
Hopefully, those that follow won't suck and you'll get a modicum of enjoyment out of what is to come
As 'The Sooze' would say, 'Love, Peace & Chicken Grease,'
Engeriser    How do you stop the Bush hate machine?  Take away the ammunition
Last night we witnessed the three greatest Democratic speeches of our new 21st century, those of Al Gore, Jimmy Carter, and Bill Clinton at the Democratic National Convention
In a work of brilliance, the Democrats clearly set the pace for a strong race
Any perception of a negative campaign has been erased
I present you with the new Democratic Party, with a positive message pointing ahead of and beyond failed Republican leadership
'Take it from me -- every vote counts'     Al Gore,  knowing the unhealed wounds of the 2000 election, was not afraid to speak the truth about what happened four years ago
He allowed us to laugh about it, as we needed to, saying 'you know the old saying: You win some, you lose some
And then there's that little-known third category', referring to our last election that was ultimately never resolved, leading to the Supreme Court appointment of George W
'And let's make sure that this time every vote is counted
Let's make sure not only that the Supreme Court does not pick the next president, but also that this president is not the one who picks the next Supreme Court,' he said
Addressing the Bush invasion of Iraq that has caused world outrage, Gore continues 'Wouldn't we be better off with a new president who hasn't burned his bridges to our allies, and who could rebuild respect for America in the world? Isn't cooperation with other nations crucial to solving our dilemma in Iraq? Isn't it also critical to defeating the terrorists?'   'We have to be crystal clear about the threat we face from terrorism
It is deadly
It is real
It is imminent
But in order to protect our people, shouldn't we focus on the real source of this threat: The group that attacked us and is trying to attack us again -- al-Qaida, headed by Osama Bin Laden? Wouldn't we be safer with a president who didn't insist on confusing al-Qaida with Iraq? Doesn't that divert too much of our attention away from the principal danger?'   'We cannot lead if our leaders mislead'     Jimmy Carter  took the stage next, giving his first speech at a Democratic National Convention since he accepted his nomination in 1980
Carter's words, spoken softly and eloquently, hit hard with a concise truth not heard in quite a while
Carter made a significant connection between George W
Bush's sketchy military record and his choices regarding Iraq: 'As many of you know, my first chosen career was in the United States Navy, where I served as a submarine officer
At that time, my shipmates and I were ready for combat and prepared to give our lives to defend our nation and its principles
'  'At the same time, we always prayed that our readiness would preserve the peace
I served under two presidents, Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower, men who represented different political parties
Both of whom had faced their active military responsibilities with honor
'  'They knew the horrors of war, and later, as commanders-in-chief, they exercised restraint and judgment and had a clear sense of mission
We had confidence that our leaders, military and civilian, would not put our soldiers and sailors in harm's way by initiating 'wars of choice' unless America's vital interests were endangered
'  'We also were sure that these presidents would not mislead us when it came to issues involving our nation's security
Today, our Democratic party is led by another former naval officer - one who volunteered for military service
He showed up when assigned to duty, and he served with honor and distinction
'   'John Kerry said, 'Send Me''    Bill Clinton,  introduced by Senator Hillary Clinton, climaxed the evening with words that invoked a frenzy of tears and enthusiastic support
He spoke of his new financial status, being in the top 1% of the nation's most wealthy, and how well he is now taken care of by the Republican Party:  'When I was in office, the Republicans were pretty mean to me
When I left and made money, I became part of the most important group in the world to them
At first I thought I should send them a thank you note -- until I realized they were sending you the bill
'  'They protected my tax cuts while:  - Withholding promised funding for the Leave No Child Behind Act, leaving over 2 million children behind  - Cutting 140,000 unemployed workers out of job training  - 100,000 working families out of child care assistance  - 300,000 poor children out of after school programs  - Raising out of pocket healthcare costs to veterans  - Weakening or reversing important environmental advances for clean air and the preservation of our forests
'  The Democratic platform this year is out to bring America together as a nation, as the Republican agenda is seen as of late to be one of 'divide and conquer'
Anticipating the negative attacks from the right, Democrats are getting a good head start at taking away some of the ammunition surely set to be soon fired off
Repulicans are seen to falter if the focus is directed mainly at the issues

OK, it's obvious I'm unhinged, but anytime someone says 'ren faire' I begin giggling uncontrollably
The reason why I begin giggling is a long story I don't feel like typing right now, but suffice to say I annoyed the fuck out of Morgan this morning with my giggling
Sorry dear, I'll try to contain myself next time, if you try to not stab yourself in the back again
It may be a practice sword, OK dagger, but it's still sharp on the end
Is that not what you tell me?      Not much went on Monday, Tuesday or today, or what there's been of today
Monday and Tuesday were spent with the aforementioned jackpipe, and I just got home about an hour ago from his house, so not much is going on
I did find out that Raffy-dog, Minerva Dave's doggy, died sometime during the night
Raffy was such a good puppy; he'll be missed
I didn't sleep for shit Monday night, so I'm beat
That is all
POKER NIGHT AT THE LAW SCHOOL Eesh
I got shit cards and played with a strategic vision worthy of Douglas Haig at the Somme, so I was the first out
Ehh, I wasn't using those $10 anyway
Later that night I dreamt I was part of an illegal poker circuit that was eventually joined by Rafael Palmeiro
We had to kill Palmeiro, who in addition to being a card cheat was apparently passing government secrets to the Cubans
The rest of the dream was spent trying to dispose of the body
We eventually traded it to a coked-up heiress along with a  haute couture  dress we'd somehow come into possession of
If there's a lesson in all this I think I've missed it
::: I'M GAY, I'M SERIOUS NO REALLY I AM :::   Sometimes I actually do forget and start to wonder what so many people are staring at
I forget how confusing I can be sometimes
My parents are going out of town soon and I will be out parting
(I worry about my parents when I stay out of the house too much) I think it's about time I had a 'stay out all night date' (you know the ones I hate that make me feel all dirty)
Yes I think It's about time to have a loveless sexual romp it's been about a year I think it's over due
The question of the week is who?  If you have any recommendation please forward them to my e-mail
I have successfully avoided one of my friends all weekend which means I don't have to go to the vibe (scary club)
I went with her once and I feel as though I paid my dues damit that bar is scary
I already live my life day to day feeling like an observer of the human species
Which is fine because I am infact the eyes in the wall and I'm truly comfortable with that
I know all, see all, and I have nothing to say about it
blah  I have an interview tomorrow with some person for something I hope it amounts to something
I do miss having someone to talk to and someone to hang out with
Having coffee just isn't the same

Ok i am out to work on me master piece
Stacia, her family, Tim, and I went to the  urlLink San Diego Wild Animal Park  on Saturday
We saw some birds, some reindeer lookin' things, but no lions or antelopes or what-have-you
There was a safari ride thing that you go on for an hour and it takes you to the range where the animals graze, but it was neither wheelchair nor stroller friendly
But even if it were, it wouldn't have been a good idea for us to go
Imagine being stuck in a trolley like thing in the middle of a wild animal reserve where any hungry mountain lion can pounce on you the second you make a sound, and your 18-month old companion (Riley) decides to suddenly start shrieking because he's hungry
not cool
Today, my parents decided to have their house blessed
In the Filipino culture, that's when a Catholic priest comes and sprinkles water all over your house
During the ceremony, I had to restrain myself from saying things like, 'What an excellent day for an  urlLink exorcism ' and 'Merrin!' The priest also decided to bless my mother
When he asked her if she would renounce Satan and all of his temptations, I was tempted to yell, 'Your mother sucks cock in hell, Karras!' Oh, come on, how could I not? I had to leave before I could embarass myself and my family
Tomorrow, I start on my new job
Hopefully, I won't hate it as much as the last  urlLink one

Magnetise your RAM; literally      Have you ever felt frustrated when you boot up your PC at the time the OS takes to boot up? If yes, then you can start rejoicing, as the solution is just aroung the corner
Although the processing power of the PCs have increased manifold over the past few years, the footprint of the OS has also grown heavier so that it offsets the increase in speed and processing power
I remember some time back when the P-II 350 Mhz PCs were the latest rage with 64MB of RAM, I measured the boot up time of the PC
It took me a whole of 35 seconds
I was running Windows 95 at that time and remember that Windows 95 was a very light weight OS as compared to the biggies of today
Today also when I test the machine booting up time on a P-4 2
4 Ghz, 256 MB RAM machine, it takes more or less the same time
Although 30 - 35 seconds may not sound a great deal, but when you are in a hurry it seems like eternity, and we are also talking about the applications processing time
The booting up process goes on something like this:  The processor starts up and the BIOS loads and passes control over to the processor   The processor reads the OS and loads the OS into RAM   The OS loads and the control is passed to the user
This process may not be 100% accurate, but this is what takes place in a nutshell
The major time is taken up when the OS is being loaded into the RAM
The conventional RAM is a volatile one which requires electricity to store data
As soon as the electric power is cut off, the data stored in the RAM is lost
As opposed to this, the  MRAM  (Magnetic RAM) uses magnetism to store the data
Magnetism as opposed to electricity, is not lost when power is removed
In fact it does not depend on electric supply at all
This will enable the PCs to run on less power as the requirement to give electric supply to RAMs at all time will not there
As with all the new technologies, the question of cost comes up
Will this technology be costly
In one word, 'No'
The manufacturers are claiming that this technology will work at the speed of a SRAM (Synchronous RAM) at the cost of DRAM (Dynamic RAM)
Given this fact made up sit up and take notice
IBM is one of the major players who are pushing hard to market this technology
You can expect this technology to hit the market sometime in 2005 as per the manufacturers
This technology has the potential to change the computing practices forever
Watch out for this

Think of it as a family for a second
My father has 2 sisters and 1 brother
They bicker and argue with each other quite a bit (at least they did when they were younger)
But, if someone outside the family, even one of the spouses of the four siblings, were to say something derogatory about one of them, the other three will circle the wagons and defend the other, even if what was said was true or something that one of them had said before
That is the way it is here
We can bicker amongst ourselves, bitch about the government, and even leave the country for a change, but if someone outside of here tells us we need to change or attacks us (verbally  or physically), we will tell you in no uncertain words to go f*** yourself
Burning the flag pisses alot of Americans off
However, it does not bother me as much to see foreigners do it in foreign countrys
It does bother me to see protestors in the US do it, because by doing so, they are saying to me that they do not like the lifestyle the US lets them lead
The lifestyle that allows them to burn the flag without being arrested or shot
As for the security issue, the same NBC report said that security was already higher than normal because of some intelligence indicating a possible Al Queda attack
They actually had some British official discussing that briefly in the report
'We ate the food, we drank the wine Everybody having a good time except you
You were talking about the end of the world
'*   Last night I went to a birthday bash at the 'Lush Lounge' in TriBeCa
Everybody had a good time dancing the night away under the influence of various forms of alcohol
I am glad that many had come to celebrate the birthday person's personal new year, and she seemed to have a great time
I myself had two drinks, but steeled my will to keep my composure
It was by my own volition, not by the ethyl alcohol influence that I danced for the last half of the evening
I danced to break down my overwhelming sense of lonliness and isolation that the evening's atmosphere heightened
People with whom I thought I had a good connection found their interests with more familiar haunts, and I moped around wondering how I came to be so passive and introverted
I took pictures that conveyed how I felt, one of which you see above
I prayed for God to turn the thoughts and feelings off, but they grew worse until I began to have some conversations with people that I didn't know
That made me feel much better
After eating out and waiting with Willy for Tina to bring back his keys, I drove back and got back in around 7 in the morning
I crawled into bed and awoke 8 hours later
'In my dream, I was drowning my sorrows But my sorrows they'd learned to swim Surrounding me, going down on me Spilling over the brim'*  And so sums up the past two years' pattern
I tried this past month to place myself in more socially engaging situations, because I knew that I needed it
I'm an extrovert that loves connecting with people, but has lived the life of an introvert due to my misery
The cell group I've been visiting has been very gracious in welcoming me and including me in their community
But to my consternation, I still find myself drowning in my inexplicable sorrows that creep up and immerse me like the clandestine tide over ocean shores
They come and go at a pace imperceptible but with effects visible
God, why do I have to be such a drag?  Why am I the pin that deflates the positive atmospheres around me?   To make matters worse, I kept thinking about someone in whom I had interest, but found the realities to point the other way
Once again I found myself staring down the hypnotic barrel of a gun without one of my own to defend myself
Must I continue on being me?  Can I now transform into something new?  Can I take up the guitar and pen, my computer and bible, my pencil and calculator, and boldly march into a new era?  The sorrows entice my heart to look down into their nefarious depths, while the glorious lights of promise shine overhead
God, help me to desire the elusive joys that hover above me, instead of the deceptive self-importance found in the sufferings below

I picked a bad time to leave
Why is some of the blog in a different language?  I feel really far behind
Hi, by the way
I love the song because almost all of it applies
I made the things that I think apply to me and how I feel bold, the rest apply some, but not as much
Memories consume like opening the wound I'm picking me apart again You all assume, I'm safe here in my room Unless I try to start again   I don't want to be the one the battles always choose 'Cause inside I realize that I'm the one confused  I don't know what's worth fighting for Or why I have to scream I don't know why I instigate And say what I don't mean I don't know how I got this way I know it's not alright So I'm breaking the habit Breaking the habit Tonight
Clutching my cure, I tightly lock the door I try to catch my breath again  I hurt much more, than any times before I have no options left again     I don't want to be the one the battles always choose 'Cause inside I realize that I'm the one confused  I don't know what's worth fighting for Or why I have to scream I don't know why I instigate And say what I don't mean I don't know how I got this way I'll never be alright So I'm breaking the habit Breaking the habit Tonight
I'll paint it on the walls 'Cause I'm the one at fault   I'll never fight again And this is how it ends   I don't know what's worth fighting for Or why I have to scream But now I have some clarity  To show you what I mean I don't know how I got this way I'll never be alright So I'm breaking the habit I'm breaking the habit I'm breaking the habit Tonight
ah, the irony! So I'm telling everyone, go read Mikey's website, and meanwhile, he changes it to what is currently there
which is hiliarious but definitely not what I wanted y'all to read
Still, go see it
There is a tremendously funny comparision of some poor sap pictured in the Onion and the trumpet professor here, John Aley
going to Milwaukee tonight with Ladies Must Swing
shall prove to be an interesting time, as playing with this group generally is
I have a feeling that I'm going to forget to do something this weekend, but I'm not quite sure what
better look into that
And all attempts to change are filled with danger
Last week, the government was behind a project of slimming up children in schools
Fine, Great, any suggestions of how they could do this? Well, why not go in there and publicise McDonald's, after all, it is the healthiest food around
Celebrity footballers were paid to come to our schools and talk about ways in which to lose weight and become fit
Some of this plan led to the recommendation of McDonald's family restaurants as an aid to the fitness program
Now, I'd like to think that I'm not just having a cheap shot at McDonald's here as that would be contraindicated, but honestly, and especially after the release of Super Size Me (which im yet to see, but I understand it was scary enough for Maccas to have to release an advert campaign to protect themselves by pointing our their understanding of the misinterpretations that this doco may have conveyed)
What was the real plan behind this odd occurrence? Is there any plan at all? Is this discrimination against the local businesses of Australia that also supply fast food? What does the government have to gain by backing this hodiernal recommendation
And I also would have expected more from some footballers, I hope it was genuine, and not simply for the money
Any thoughts?
Tuesdays At GSC   The Engagement Rings e-mail came from Jaz w/c in turn came from a friend of hers
These so-called engagement rings include the  urlLink Missionary  position w/c Shai identified as the 6th picture in the mail
Before this mail we, er, they were talking about engagements and weddings
Tina is going to spend 50,000 for hers
Half of it for liposuction because she wants to be beautiful on her wedding day
She means not fat
Tina is already cute

urlLink    Pistons trying to inbound the ball
Who else felt that?  I thought someone ran into our building
I feel like i've been run over by a truck, emotionally speaking
I have gone through so much shit in the past two days, it's amazing that I am still sitting here and not huddling under my covers in bed
My best friend's dad committed suicide yesterday, while surrounded by a SWAT team from the RCMP
This is now the second successful suicide amongst parents of friends, and the third attempt at suicide amoungst my friend's parents
My first boyfriend's dad had attempted suicide 3 or 4 times, and I saw how the family was torn apart by that
Last year, the mother of a friend of ours robbed a bank, then basically committed suicide (she worked for the local district attorney and she turned the gun onto the police and they shot her)   I just don't understand it
I was thinking this morning
who the hell is phoning me at 8:30 just before I leave, and OH SHIT it's not something good if they are phoning now
Sure enough, I hear my best friend weeping on the line
First, I actually thought it was my mom crying about something that happened to my dad, and then I realized it was my best friend
She went on to tell me that her dad had gone to her grandma's place to take care of the farm, and that he was actually missing for a few days
Her mom had gone to the farm to find her dad (it is her grandma's farm), because they had finally talked to him, and he was apparently hearing voices, was very delusional, and was convinced that 'they were trying to take the farm away from him'
In a sense, very messed up
He was very paranoid that someone was out to get him
So of course, the SWAT team showing up did not help at all
He took a gun and locked himself in either the house or barn (couldn't hear between sobs)
There, surrounded by the SWAT team, he killed himself
Her mom appeared on the scene, only to see the house and whole road blocked off, not knowing what was going on
She's obviously inconsolable right now
I talked to her for about 15 minutes this morning before she left to go meet her mom
I hope she phones tonight, as she promised, but I'd completely understand if she doesn't
I sent her an email as I told her I would, giving her my lab phone #, my office #, my two email addresses (she only remembers my house #), and told her that if she wants me at the funeral, I'd be happy to attend
Not because I knew him (I had only met her mom), but becuase she may need someone to hold her up
It just makes me so sad because she is an only child, and her dad was so special to her
He had no history of depression or schizophrenia, and apparently he had only begun to talk like this for the past week that he was at the farm
I don't know if it was an unrecognized problem or whether it was triggered by something
hallucinogenic ergot (we all saw X-files where that rye gave them all delusions and hallucinations)
I have no idea
Either way, her mom is completely floored
they were high-school sweethearts that loved each other so much
What sort of trend is this?  Parents should die of natural causes, not like this
It just makes it harder when they choose to end their own life
makes the people left behind blame themselves
Went over to Wes and Bret's today, we ended up playing games all day (big suprise)
We started out with Red Faction for a couple hours
Wes was being a camping whore
he hid in a corner and used a gun that could shoot through the walls
After I gave up on that I went on to both Wes and Bret's computers and deleted Internet Explorer and installed Mozilla FireFox
Bret was telling me that his mom now plays  urlLink Neopets  and Counter Strike
lol so now they can play Counter Strike together
and it would be really funny if their mom was some '1337 h4xx0r' as some 10 year old losers would say
Anybluh
after I messed around on their computers for awhile we went and played some Perfect Dark on the N64, Me and Wes VS
I think Bret got kinda mad, cause me and Wes kept disarming, which makes him really dizzy
then some one shot him while he couldn't see anything on his screen
but I'm not sure who kept doing that
*shifty eyes*
and eventually I went home
lol, for some reason I downloaded the new japanese Yu-Gi-Oh episode 212
it makes me mad at how edited the english version is
-First of all there IS swearing in the japanese version -In the english version Bakura sounds like some old guy, but in the japanese version he ACTUALLY SOUNDS LIKE HE'S A 14 YEAR OLD KID!!! -The Japanese version also seems much
darker (in an evil kind of)  So I was trying to send 25 episodes of Hikaru no Go to my downstairs computer that has the DVD burner on it
but something crapped out, so I gotta figure something out, otherwise Bret will want his DVD-RW's back
and I dont really wanna give them back (he gave me 30 or so for free)

what else is new?&nbsp; Well, I've been studying quite a bit of neurology this weekend, and am getting close to putting most of this stuff all together
&nbsp; And I've been thinking lately, as I've been doing more and more neurology this semester, I'm actually considering it as a career now
&nbsp; I'm not sure if I'm smart enough to become a neurosurgeon, but I think I can get into Internal Medicine, and specialize in neurology if anything
&nbsp; Bah, who knows what will happen
&nbsp;  Ok, that's all for now folks
&nbsp; Bye bye
&nbsp;  P
guess who has a Gmail account now!? ;)
I had two auditions yesterday
One was fun
One was not
Let's start with the not fun one
The audition was for a commercial for a new candy bar, and they wanted people who could do weird tricks to come in and perform them
I made the mistake of telling a prospective agent that I could balance big things on my chin, so they submitted me
(Sidenote: I  can  balance big things on my chin
A guitar, a ladder, brooms, 2x4s, etc
I can do that
But I'm not a professional
)  Anyway, I wanted to bring in something fun to balance, since I wanted them to remember me
After scouring our apartment for something interesting, I landed on the most fascinating thing we had that could be balanced
I thought, 'It's unique, I can break it down to fit it in my bag, it's perfect!':  A friggin'  urlLink Swiffer
I'm stupid
I ended up having almost no chance to practice with it
Had I taken to time to practice, I would have discovered then (instead of  at the audition ) that a Swiffer's lightness and low density, while great for getting dirt out of hard-to-reach places, is not conducive to balancing on a chin
After a short interview (read:  lie ) about 'how I discovered this amazing talent,' I tilted my head back and placed the handle on my chin
I weaved back and forth, trying to remain jovial and confident
'I'll get it!', I proclaimed
I began sweating and shaking a little
Again - I'm no pro - but sweating and shaking add a little challenge to balancing
I know
Shocking
Needless to say, I didn't 'get it
' I took the Swiffer off of my chin, took it apart as quickly as I could, shoved it in my bag, thanked the auditors, and got out as quickly as I could
FUN SIDE NOTE:  The guys ahead of and behind me in line were members of a college clown troupe
And were balancing large objects on their faces
I think we can safely count out the chance of seeing me advertising any candy bars any time soon
The morning was quite cool and windy, like a warm winters day
I was going to wear my winter long coat (trench coat) for outside, but decided against it
I wish I had taken it now- it was really really cold
I was at work for a couple of hours, but then again my throat got too sore, so I went home rather early
I think I have passed on my sickness to someone else as well
Another person at work who sits near me went home earlier today, complaining of the same symptoms as myself
I’m contagious!  When I got home, I made some dinner and slept for about four hours
I am not sure if it is because I am really sick, or if I am just exhausted from lack of sleep
I don’t think I am sleep deprived, but then who sleeps for four hours in the afternoon?   When I wake up- I see on the news that it had been SNOWING up in the hills today
Only in Victoria (perhaps Tasmania too…)- snow in the middle of summer, while the rest of the country burns up in heat! Again, I would much rather be snuggled up in coats and pants and under blankets rather than sweating it out in a heatwave
That is why I left Queensland after all, the weather suits me better here
I spent some of the afternoon looking through the internet for rentals on the other side of town
I applied for some leave so I can go look at some houses through the week as well next month
Some of them look very nice, and very cheap as well
One has to wonder why it is so cheap out there
Oh well, who cares, as long as it is more money in my pocket! I have also applied for a transfer to another office in that area, incase my application for a job I have gone for is unsuccessful
Actually, regarding job applications- I received two letters from a government department about a job I applied for quite some time ago
The letters basically said that the jobs were no longer available etc etc
No big drama… as I had forgotten all about them
Except, I thought the letters were from ANOTHER agency which I had been in for an interview for a few weeks ago
I called them to ask about my name being kept on a backup list- in the event the jobs were to become vacant again, I asked if I would automatically be shortlisted without having to apply again
Of course, I rang the wrong department/agency, however I did not let them know that
They asked for me to fax the letter that I had gotten, and now I have to make up some story so stop me looking like a total idiot
In the end- the job I went for an interview for still has not been decided- so there is still hope
Then again, I really do not want to remain in the same agency for much longer- it is time for a change
something new, something more challenging…   Nothing much more happened today
A sick boy does not get up to much in Melbourne……

The other night, I went out for dinner with a friend
We wandered into this random restaurant, and ordered something called He-jang-guk, we only knew enough to know that it was some sort of soup involving seafood
It was actually very tasty, lots of fish and beansprouts and just enough peppers to give it a kick, not your typical spiced to the max heavy duty broth with the oil slick on top
When the ajumma brought it to the table, she took pity on the clueless foreign types and showed us how to go about eating it, talking to us in Korean
The one thing she did say that we could understand was 'diet food
' Hmmm
Later in the meal, noticing that we hadn't touched our rice, she came over again and opened them up (the rice bowl are metal and have lids) to show us that, hey, there's rice in here
But neither of us really wanted to eat it
And she started talking to us, probably the way any mother would scold their kid, 'You know you have to eat your rice or you're going to get sick,' or something along those lines
Anyways, I felt so guilty that I ate half of it
JournalCon was fun
Next time it'll be a day thing as sleep didn't work out well
However massive props to all of you for sitting through Season One of Sports Night
LOST & FOUND: Marten, you forgot your games and your memory card
Did anyone forget a stick of deodorant?  That was fun
We really need to do it again sometime
Season Two is waiting
But you could be having sex with Yoko Ono right now!
So, I went to see The Village tonight
One of the many things I had to get used to while living in Austin was going and doing things by myself
With an occasional exception, I usually go to movies, restaurants, and whatever shopping I do, by myself
This doesn't bother me, and living here for almost a year now, I'm used to it
What's great about it is that I get to pay attention to what strangers are saying and doing around me
People are strange
The couple sitting next to me tonight discussed what they believed would be 'the ultimate dance club
' See-thru walls into the bathrooms, headphones for everyone so an individual could control how loud they wanted the music,  and mp3 players so each individual could listen to what they wanted while dancing with other people listening to what they wanted
And the entire club was shag carpeting with no shoes allowed
The Village was, well, pretty good
The problem is that with his movies you are always looking and trying to figure out the twist because you know it's coming
If you figure it out early, the movie isn't completely done
you can sit there and try to appreciate what he's doing to get to where he wants to go
The idea is there, it's done pretty well, the acting is so-so, and that's about it
Go see it
And take someone with you if it's a Saturday night
People think you're weird when the seat next to you is empty and it's one of the only seats left in a sold out theatre

This is my worst nightmare
I don't want to go to the dentist, so I put it off and put it off until something is wrong and I'm forced to go
I damn near need a valium just to get in the door
My stomach is fluttering, my palms are sweating, and I'd do just about anything to get out of there
I would leave, but I need to know what's wrong so I stay
The whole place seems dark and ominous
No one seems to enjoy their jobs very much -- no one is smiling or friendly, they all seem to want to get out of there as much as I do
I'm taken back to the room but they won't let Bobby come with me
(I'd actually walk out of a place that did that, but for the sake of the nightmare, Bobby can't come in with me
)  So I have to sit back there alone waiting for Dr
Sadist to show up
When he does, he's very somber and morose, unfriendly, unsmiling, just as miserable as everyone else in the place
He looks at me like I'm a nutcase for being afraid to be there
He's very matter-of-fact about the whole thing -- you need to get your teeth checked, no one likes it, you just do it, so suck it up
He doesn't understand my fears at all
He's very swift and doesn't take the time to let me know what he's doing
He gets annoyed by me hesitating to open my mouth for him
When I finally do, he starts right in with no preamble or explanation
He's got that pointy thing they use and he's poking around all over my teeth and gums
He doesn't talk to me while he's doing this at all
He doesn't seem to have any empathy about what he's doing, either, he's just poking at me without a care in the world
He's cutting into my gums, making me bleed, letting me rinse only when he needs to see better
He doesn't think my TMJ should hinder me from keeping my mouth open for two hours straight while he pokes and prods around in my mouth
When he's done looking around he says I need a lot of work done
I have cavities that need to be drilled, I have to have a root canal, need my wisdom teeth pulled, and he's going to do it all right then
He pulls out a needle the size of my arm and sticks it into my gums without even telling me he's going to do it
I was going to ask him to use the spray-on novacaine first to numb the shot a little, but I didn't get a chance to ask before he just did it
It's excruciating but he doesn't seem to notice
It's supposed to be numbing my mouth but I can still feel stuff
I try to tell him that but he doesn't listen
He says it takes a minute to kick in and it'll be fine in a while
So he starts with the drill
That is the most miserable feeling in the world
My whole mouth is vibrating from it, it starts hitting a nerve in my tooth and the pain is horrible
I start to squirm around because of it and his hand slips and the drill hits my mouth
Now I'm bleeding and have a hole where there isn't supposed to be one
He tells me to sit still and keeps going
He's working very fast, like he's rushed and just wants to finish the job, annoyed by how much there is to do
The drilling hurts, but the filling is finally done
Without giving me a minute to catch my breath and relax a bit, he starts in on the root canal
I've never had one before so I don't know exactly what's involved, but I know it hurts like a bitch
Then he grabs these big clamp-like things and latches them on to my wisdom tooth and just starts pulling
It makes me sick to my stomach, the pain is so bad, the feeling of him wiggling my tooth around until it starts to loosen, and then he's in there with that pokey thing again trying to pry the tooth out
I feel like I want to pass out
This happens three more times with the rest of the wisdom teeth
When he's finally finished, he wants to give me a cleaning
As if I'm not sore enough, he starts in with the scrapy thing, and then the buffer thing, and they're hitting all the work he's just done and rubbing against the sore spots, but he doesn't care, he just keeps going
He finishes with the cleaning and tells me I can go
He's got this twisted little smirk on his face while he's writing up the paperwork, which comes to a couple thousand dollars
I feel miserable and it's a week before I can eat solid foods again
My jaw aches, I have bruises around my mouth, and I think I'll be waiting another ten years or so before I go through this nightmare again
Coming to the realisation that I may not be able to eat sweet food anymore thanks to mystery ache in tooth
devastating  BARGAIN BUYER'S TIP: Also, discovered that Home Brand 'Tim Tams' ($1
32) from Safeway are almost as good as regular Tim Tams ($2
After a packet, also realised my mouth was in agony due to sore tooth

Killer business: Murder on the Beach bookstore   By Scott Eyman, Palm Beach Post Books Editor Sunday, May 16, 2004  There are those who think that running a bookstore must be romantic and relaxing: wearing your smoking jacket, sitting in an armchair with pipe clenched firmly in teeth, indulging in civilized badinage with like-minded customers as you peruse leather-bound copies of Proust
Once you've actually done it, you find out it's a lot closer to laboring on septic tanks, but by the time you learn the truth, the illusions of youth can never be recaptured
Joanne Sinchuk's Murder on the Beach has been in Delray Beach's Pineapple Grove section for a year and a half now, after seven years in Aventura, and there are times when she pines for her old job as a certified public accountant
Well, not really
But being a CPA was certainly less work
'Before I opened,' she says with a sigh, 'I did the right thing and wrote out a business plan
And when I look at it now, I laugh at how much I didn't know
'  There are 60 mystery bookstores scattered throughout the country, but Sinchuk's is the only one in Florida
Her store carries somewhere between 12,000 and 15,000 titles, in hardcover and paperback
Because Murder on the Beach is a specialized store, it has a specialized clientele
'I have customers from Miami Beach who drive up here,' she says
'I have customers from all over the world on the Internet
'  Sinchuk is an independent, and can't offer the deep discounts of the chain stores, so she has to be nimble and concentrate on obscurities and figure out who the Next Big Thing will be before anybody else does
The customers at a mystery bookstore also have different levels of sophistication
For instance, Sinchuk has yet to sell her first copy of John Grisham's latest thriller, although it has been out for several months
'My clientele is more intellectual, and more serious about the form
I sell very few books to people who don't like to read, which I think describes a lot of the mysteries that make the bestseller list
'  Sinchuk owes it all to Agatha Christie, with whom she fell in love while growing up in Bridgeport, Conn
'I made up a list of all of her novels, and I would check them off as I read them
'   When she was working as a CPA in New York City, she would regularly shop at Otto Penzler's Mystery Bookstore, and would indulge herself by thinking how much fun it would be to run a similar place
Finally taking the plunge, she opened her store in Aventura, and did well, but the increase in the Hispanic population made the survival of a English-language bookstore problematic
It was time to head north
'I didn't see anything I liked in Fort Lauderdale and Boca Raton, but a customer told me about Delray Beach, and I loved it immediately
'  Fully 30 percent of Sinchuk's business derives from mail order and Internet, largely autographed copies of books set in Florida, which seems to have joined Los Angeles as a primary setting for the genre
(Sinchuk sold more copies of Fort Lauderdale author Jonathon King's The Blue Edge of Midnight online than she did in her store
)  Because of her sales of autographed books by mail and online, author appearances are particularly important
Sinchuk regularly nabs such stars as Michael Connelly, who appears at the store tonight, and John Sandford
Her main target for a future signing is Alexander McCall Smith, the author of the popular series about a detective agency set in Botswana
The market for mysteries has metastasized in the past 15 years
There are knitting mysteries, animal mysteries, cooking mysteries and hairdresser mysteries to go up against the usual private detectives, cops and bounty hunters
There's even a mystery series set in Cleveland, which would seem to limit your audience
'I'm not even sure Cleveland was the worst choice,' says Sinchuk
'Elaine Viets had a series set in St
Louis, but nobody outside of St
Louis wants to read about St
So she started setting stuff in Fort Lauderdale, and her career took off
'   While independent bookstores all over America have gone belly up in the past 10 years, niche stores like Murder on the Beach have managed to survive even though, to an outsider, it would seem hard to fail in a business where you can return all your unsold inventory for full credit
But as Sinchuk points out: 'If I sell a book for $20, I paid $14 for it
And how many other businesses are there where the retailer has no control over price?'  For the future, Sinchuk sees no particular signs of weakening in the genre
Her business is headed up, even though about 50 percent comes from snowbirds, and she has the usual summer downdraft
She sees the best new writers as being Jonathon King, the Irish writer John Connolly and the mother-daughter team that goes by the name P
Divorced with no children, Sinchuk remains an avid consumer of mysteries, although it's not what she reads for relaxation anymore
'I read chick-lit,' she says, 'especially English chick-lit
Meg Cabot is my current favorite
You can polish a book off in one night, and it's fun

I have just returned from walking Julia home (through the crime ridden streets of Peterborough, no less)
We attended the Petrus concert at the church - a wonderful performance
The first half was Dmitri's Piano Trio No
3, followed by an interval (free drinks!) and then the End of Time thing - a musical representation of part of the Book of Revelations
Both were stunning performances - very moving
I walked Julia home, returned home, made myself tea, and Mum and Mark came back soon after - with a Doner Kebab! My first ever
It's delicious
I can't believe I've never tried it before
Very nice
i think i love u
alot and the words u say to me, mean more to me than anything else
yet with you comes flaws, sometimes so big that no matter how hard i try to force myself to
i cant look past them
Makes me almost want to hate you
tho i know it wudn't be reasonable
because you havent done anything to me right? cept say those words
that mean so much it makes me want to cry and makes me want to cry harder if i shall ever find those words to fail me
to have truly finally realize that the little blackness of doubts inside me was true all along
words are nothing but lies
WELL HAPPY BIRTHDAY GOBLIND@BLOGSPOT
I must admit that since erin squeezed you out, you have developed into quite the post-modern, information dissemination platform
Or to put it another way
you have become a fascinating, integral and voyeuristic pitstop in my day to day life
You represent an abstract and unfocused distillation of what we think is important, the things we want to reveal about ourselves, our belief systems, our tastes, our flights of fancy, our whimsical musings, our accute observations, our fears, our dreams and most importantly a lasting record of a most remarkable set of relationships
Its strange that many of the throw away comments made in this forum, actually combine to present a wonderfully revealing, warts and all picture of those that made them
Blog is a strange little miracle of the modern age, a document that hints at honesty and community
The sum total of whatever we felt like contributing
and look at what we made

Well, I  was  working on a site for my projects, but I keep getting DNS errors
It's such a pain! I can't even work on anything site-wise
But oh well
I'm thinking about switching servers
This one has been giving me problems since I started using it
Once I get the site up, I can start with the code
I also have some other web projects that I need to finish as well, so I'm not sure when I'll get some more time to put into gaming
Hopefully this week sometime
I just finished running doing pushups and situps and stretching
It was not nearly as bad as I thought it would be
However, this may have something to do with the fact that I have to walk every where here
Anyway
gotta go to work  Eddie off to control
Well one of my friends and their girlfriend got into a bit of a rough spot today
He read some stuff he shouldn't have, and understandably she was upset & hurt
But anyway, he came to me for advice and I told him everything I could
Later I talked to her on the phone, and it seemed like things were ok
Much later in the evening I talked to her boyfriend again, and I found out they are speaking again so that is good
My girlfriend came over to hang out today too
She was over while I was talking to my friend's girlfriend and I noticed she got a bit upset looking
Once I was off the phone we had a bit of a talk, and it turns out she is feeling a bit jealous of my friendship with this woman
She is worried that something will 'happen' between us, and this is an understandable worry since I did hurt her in the past
But it still bugs me that just when I think we have moved past it, something happens that brings it all back
To quote myself from when I was talking about my relationship with a friend,   Shit man, soon enough you'll end up like me
All fucked by shit going on with your girlfriend and then you reach the point where you just don't give a shit anymore and either things will work out &amp; you'll be happy or they won't and it wil end
But all at the same time, you can't just leave her because you love her too much to hurt her
And again, I know that is a bit of an extreme view of things but I plan to just continue things as they are going and just see where they go

what's up with exclusive tracks on itunes? i went to the store and saw that the darkness has two exclusive track on there
so then i thought, i'd rather get my music for free
so i went on kazaa and one of the songs was on there
downloaded it, same song and it sounds good
yeah, real exclusive
Some nights, I sit at home by myself, tossing back the remnants of a bottle of Dewars and watching Nightline trying to ease the pain of yet another 18 hour wake cycle and bracing myself for the next to come
It's weird, I spend so much time being out and trying to be 'popular' with the DJ thing that sometimes, when I'm at home alone, it can get a little lonely
But what am I to do?  How do I fill this seeming void in my life?  How can I make it to the next day knowing that I'll have to go it alone once again?  Well, I think I found the solution
Jerome Benton
You know Jerome from The Time (Jesse, n-now Jerome!), he's the perfect affect to my (and your) low self esteem and lonliness issues
Who better to laugh at my jokes, tell me I look good, hold my mirror, and throw ice cold glasses of champagne in women's faces when they refuse to go out with me
Jerome did it all for Morris Day and dammit if I don't think he can't do it for me too
Jerome can fill the void
Jerome is the best friend I need
Sidekicks and henchmen aren't easy to come by, but I think I need one
Topic 6: Bad Ideas
If you ever feel a specific need to try to eat the rest of a cold meatball sub at 4 in the morning, and wash it down with warm tapwater, let me tell you now, it's not a good idea
Hey everyone
I'm at my Dad's work right now on lunch break
Its bad, he's at a meeting and I'm all by myself
Today has just been long and boring
Friday was good for no reason just as today is bad
I guess when you have some place to go for lunch and you know its Friday, you have a better day
Talked to my cousin Cait for a bit, she works here too
I have senior pics tomorrow at nine, so I'm getting my nails done at Marshall Fields tonight at 6

Last night we had book club at Emily's house
It was so cute she had an English theme with triangle sandwiches, scones, tea, fruit in wine glasses and much more
The food was absolutely delicious and it will be hard to outdo this one
Not many people actually got through the book and even fewer liked it, but that was fine because there was definalty no lack of conversation the whole night
We're still not sure what book we're going to read next month but we'll decide some time today
My Mom suggested this fictional book called  Jane Austen's Book Club
A book about a book club  for  book club
I read a review in the paper for this other book which was a true story of a Jewish woman escaping the Nazi's as a kid
I forget the title, I'll have to look it up
Its kinda weird because our next meeting is two days before school starts
We're so close to the end of summer
--And I still haven't looked at any colleges!  Man all my friends have at least looked at a few with Kelly looking at somewhere around 157
Well, not really but you get the idea, I'm sure she's researched that many
I think I kind of want to be a teacher
I want to also study theology and philosophy but those majors leave me open for teaching
I wonder if I have the patience to work with little kids
Will I get burnt out like so many teachers I see?  Who knows
1:37, I have to go back at 2 and I want to research that book
Until next time folks
The company(VanguardMS) is getting clear to shuting down itself, while the effort of pursuing a buyer is going dim, it has no other choice
Having been working on the same company for 5 years, it is not a short time for me, it is almost half of my career so far, and I love the work I was doing, ie
the network protocol development is kind of fun as well as challenge for me
Looking to the future, I don't know if I can get the same fun out of the job, anyway, the money to support the life is more important
During the 5 years, even it maybe only a short time from some points of view, the company has been changed a lot, from Motorola to VanguardMS, with different style of company cultures, you can feel the different bettween working for a big company and a middle(or small) size company, during these years, you can also feel the big changes in the IT field, and the global econocial changes, people are talking about IT jobs outsourcing, the outlook is pretty dim for IT worker in America like us
Anyway, this is a change in my life, maybe it is even a chance for me, or maybe I am just too much optimistic and should keep in mind the tough life waiting for me?
urlLink this story  is from the beginning of july
happened right near my house
in fact i saw it, almost
i was running late for a haircut and stopped at the supermarket for a snack
i noticed all the police in the parking lot and the car covered with a white sheet
well, none of my business, i figured, and i just kept going
but after i read what happened, i can't help but think 'what if' i had gotten there 10 minutes earlier? what if someone had taken notice of this guy, about to kill himself, in a busy supermarket parking lot? i imagine doing something heroic like talking him out of it; but chances are i would have just run from a guy with a gun
It's been a long time since I watched the Olympics
The fact that I don't have cable and thus no channels on my TV to choose from not withstanding, I just haven't been interested in it for years
It seems to me that the Olympics is no longer about being higher, faster or stronger, it's all about money
It's no longer about coming together to compete in a spirit of brotherhood, it's about gathering as many sponsorships as possible
Doping scandals, judging scandals, bombings, etc
has only deepened my cynicism all the more
Never mind that every country that donated funds to help build the new IOC complex in Switzerland have all received the Games, or that judges have received huge bribes, er, I mean gifts from committee's trying to bring the games to their city
So much for the purity of sport
Now here's the latest
The Iranian Judo champion rigged his weigh-in to be found overweight so that he wouldn't have to fight an Isreali competitor
He was disqualified from the meet
According to Abdollah Ramanzanzadeh, a spokesperson for the Iranian government, it would be against: '[O]ur policy to recognize the Zionist regime in any international event
We cannot accept the presence of anyone in international events under the flag of that regime
'  Heaven forbid that Muslims and Jews actually  meet on a field of battle where they can't actually kill each other
Admittedly, Isreal is not a shining example of religious tolerance, but Iran is hardly one to throw stones either
At best, the Olympics are supposed to be about putting aside political differences and competing together as athletes first
At worst, it's about settling international differences using sport as the proving ground instead of the battlefield
What Iran has done flies in the face of those ideals
What has the IOC to say about this?  Nothing, not a peep
According to IOC representative Giselle Davies:  'The issue has not actually come on the agenda of the IOC,' she said at today's press conference
I guess it would be too much to expect the IOC to take a moral stand on this issue
Haven's know that they've never done it before
and, less he thinks he is forgotten, thank you ben for starting this great blog site!

Tragically Torn Apart
The trip with Stad and Lin Xi ended a little later than intended and was setting me back on my work by quite a bit
Stad and us departed at Clementi MRT station after we missed our station at Bouna Vista
Lin Xi and I reached back hall at around 12 midnight and it was time to work for me
Preparation of proposals to be mailed out to potential partners was to occupy me for almost 1 hour until Ivan came to room while on his way to collect laundry
Ivan is one of my better friends in Hall and we have a common interest in gym-training
We chatted for almost 2 hours while he waited for his laundry to be ready, and it conjured images when we first met:    It was during orientation and I just gotten to make some new friends - Shih Yang, Ivan, Stad and Praveen
For us, the common interest is becoming fitter and an unusual fondness for physical training
Almost every night after dismissal from a long day of orientation, the 6 of us will gather at the foyer forming up in a circle and start doing varieties of push-ups
1 year ago, I would have laugh myself silly to even think of exercisins to lose weight, but now I am exhilrated after 30 'diamonds', 30 'standards' and 30 'spiders'
How people can change so much
This entire idea of the 'push-up club' started when I met Ivan (coincidentally back then was also collecting his laundry) while out on my corridor hanging my clothes
Being the few 'rare' Singaporeans in hall, we sort of identified with each other immediately
We chatted at the corridor outside my room and was soon joined by the rest
The chat with Ivan was long and ranged from work to WWE and movies
I have to admit that it was a long while since we chatted and I am occasionally lost for topics now
Luckily, there was always gym and exercises to restart the dialogue
In a sense, the chat was very much welcomed as it definitely smoothen that certain amount of friction had arisen after I was appointed the FOC chairperson
I was giving him (Ivan is the Hall president) a relatively hard time during my negotiation with the Float committee back then and one issue had led to another and since then I find it a little awkward to talk with him
Looking back, it really seems somewhat childish to be bickering over the issues that hogged both my FOC committee and the Float committee
I have to admit the relationship with people from Float, a majority of which were friends, had taken a pretty bad downturn
For Shih Yang, fortunately, things were different and I truly appreciated his friendship and support
Anyway, the chat with Ivan was a welcomed relief and assurance that we are still friends, things I supposed should be back to the old time after he finishes his term as president
From 330am onwards, I was rushing through all the materials to be prepared for the sponsorship proposals
And it was amazing how long it actually took just to prepare 8 copies of decent proposals
I finished at around 540am and headed upstairs to wake Lin Xi up for her morning flight
Breakfast was at 620am after I helped Lin xi with her lagguage
I had Nasi Lemak at NUH and a bottle of my favourite yogurt drink
I returned to my room at around 710 and spent the next 1 hour or so watching the WestlemaniaXX that Ivan lend to me - specifically only the Playboy's Evening Grown match - since that was the only one match that I missed
At around 2pm, I was woken up from my sleep after dozing off from the watching WestlemaniaXX by a sequence of urgent knocks on my door
Apparently, the office knew that Lin Xi had passed her room key to me so that I can check-out her room on her behalf
It was a scandlous affair and it seems like there were many misconceptions by many people about my relation with her
Then again, I would too if I was one of them
Apart from working hard on the planning of FOC and the theatrical production for next year, I had spend much of past 2 weeks helping Lin Xi with her website
The fact that she had shifted to the room just above mine made our meetings more frequent and it was bad when many of my colleagues stayed at the same block as us
Anyway, having settled her room check-out, I was to finish some matters of my own - to send out the proposals
I asked for official envelops from Jackyln, only to incur the unreasonable outlash by the hall manager Rose
It seems mightily unhelpful if Rose was to continue precieving resources of hall's ownership as seperate from that of hall's student activities when the financial support we harness on behalf of the hall goes into hall's account
Since needing to go out to settle my matters, I decided it was good to prehaps meet up with my best friend, Weisheng
I had actually promised to meet him on the previous Friday but had not being able to do so due to some delay in a committee meeting
After dropping my mails at Bouna Vista station, I took a train to City Hall where we were suppose to meet though that meeting will occur only in another 2 and a half hours
The ride was a good 30 minutes and I was glad to be having some reading material
It was a biannual report on local literature and arts, and this issue explores the micro and macro social interactions that defines 'self'
The first article is a postscript of Chris Mann's lecture entitled 'Engaging the Cosmic Dust, the Shades and the Poetry of the Self'
The article was well-written and enlightening with its concept of shades
'Shades', he had stated in the article as spiritual manifestation of others in one self
An individual is an inner, spiritual society of 'shades' that interacts amongst themselves and influence the self
Identifying 'shades' and reconginzing their presence and 'suggestions' is the way to reidentifying oneself
'How often do I actually realized these 'shades' in me?', I thought
Weisheng is definitely a 'shade', in fact, it would be ridiculous that he was not since we had been friends for 10 years and confided in each other our feelings and secrets
Not to mention also that in him there was always much to be learnt
I met him at around 645pm or 650pm
When I saw him, it struck me how more fragile he looked compared to the last time
We walked from City Hall to Clark Quay in 'hope' to meet our long-lost 'friend', Boon Siong and fortunately we did not succeed, hence unfortunately we need to walk all the way back to Fullerton One
At Fullerton One, we had some bites and took time off to chat at Baker's Inn
There were so much to talk about and inevitably, we also talked about Boon Siong and the people we met back in NS days
We finished at Baker's Inn at around 920pm and headed to the Merlion Park where we sat on some 'arty-farty' post-modernist fancy scupltures that serve as highly comfortable seats
There we chatted more
It seems to me that till now due to some unknown reasons, both us, when it comes to girls, still have this sense of inferiority
Our final stop was at Esplanade and chat we did once again
It was literally non-stop talking from the moment we met at City Hall MRT, and I guess we would not have had this much to say should we be studying together
We departed at around 1100pm and I reached hall at 1247pm after a short supper at NUH
It had been a long night
For two days, I had been connecting with people, a thing I seldom do and that I should try doing more
Like what Weisheng said at Esplanade, I need to open more and when I befriend people, I should sincerely want to do so
For the past 2 years since coming to NUS, I had not made many friends and felt insecure but failing to realize that I had not actually being sincere in befriending people(though reasons of having not attended lessons is one main factor in a sense)
Somehow I also benchmarked friends too much with my existing group with Weisheng, Eechyi, Zhang Di, Mark and 'Riders of K

AAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH omgomgomgomgomgomgomgomgomg i haven't been online since LAST MONDAY! we had to disconnect the computer to put it in the other room to act as a stereo because ours broke
Yeah and apperently we needed a stereo because my family was coming over for xmas eve
Ok so now i have to tell everyone what has happened for the past week
Alright on tuesday (xmas eve) my family came over and that's just not even worth going into detail about
But i did get 10 things i hate about you, which is always a plus
Then christmas we opened more presents and i got lotr on dvd WOOT and i got a cook book from the oh-so-sexy, oh-so-talented, oh-so-british Jamie Oliver
WOOT again
Then tursday i went to see two towers (again) with heather laurel and madeline
Madeline had cut her own hair so after the movie we like ambushed her trying to get her hair down
Everyone was staring at us like 'omg why are they gang raping her' but its nice to know that no matter how loud you scream people won't come to help you, only point and say 'wow what losers
' Yeah so while we were trying to get madeline's hair down and we're all like yelling and shit this guy like 50 feet away goes 'yo are you talking to me' and we're like 'does it look like we're talking to you, you stupid egomaniac!' Anyway, on friday pretty much nothing happened, my parents friends came over and brought their kids
They brought dvds with them, how sad is that they have to be constantly watching tv
Anyway so we watched star wars 2
mmm ewan mcgreggor
Everyone loved Hayden Christenson (sp?) in that movie but i disagree its all about ewan
Then saturday my uncle and aunt came down, that was cool-ish
Then on sunday anna came over, and then we went to see two towers (her 2nd time, my 3rd)
Yup thats pretty much all that happened
I think that this article is absolutely on the mark - so much so that most people will vehemently deny its validity because of the chance that all the ideas they hold true might collapse in one burst of enlightenment
Read it and decide for yourself
continues war against common sense  By Joshua Levinson - Daily Campus, University of Connecticut     'This is Stacey
This is the dime bag that Stacey bought
This is the dealer who sold the dime bag that Stacey bought
This is the supplier that smuggled the pot to the dealer who sold the dime bag that Stacey bought
And this is Carla, who was hit by a stray bullet from Stacey's supplier and paralyzed for life
Drug money supports terrible things
If you buy drugs, you might too
'  This is just one example of a new wave of drug commercials by the Office of Drug Control Policy (ODCP) that prey on the fear of terrorism
Aside from being misleading and dishonest, some of the commercials are so lacking in any sort of common sense or factual information that one can only wonder why they were created at all
In another commercial, we see two men sitting at a table, discussing how drug money supports terrorism
One of them, clearly the sensible one (you can tell he's smart because he's wearing glasses), says that drug money supports terror: it's a fact
The other one, clearly lacking in moral fiber, says, 'Let's say I buy some dope
Now how much of my money actually makes it into the bad guy's hands? A couple of bucks
Peanuts
' The first man (remember, he knows what he's talking about) replies, 'So what you're saying is that it's okay to support terrorism
a little
'  Now, let's say for a minute that we forget that even the ODCP itself admits that marijuana comes primarily from Mexico and, in some lesser extent, Canada and the United States itself (we are assuming that by drugs, they mean marijuana, since it's the only drug they seem to have commercials about anymore)
You want some real facts on funding terrorism? In 1982, Iraq had just been removed from the list of states supporting terrorism, despite evidence that this wasn't true
The Reagan administration then proceeded to give Iraq billions of dollars and military intelligence so that they could win the war with Iran
'CIA Director Casey personally spearheaded the effort to ensure that Iraq had sufficient military weapons, ammunition and vehicles to avoid losing the Iran-Iraq war
'  Am I making this up? Unfortunately, no
This information is all from a sworn affidavit of Howard Teicher, a member of Reagan's National Security Council at the time
In other words, the United States provided the weaponry and intelligence that Iraq used to win the war with Iran, subsequently, to invade Kuwait, which lead to fighting and the killing of American soldiers
So, who supports terrorism? Our government
I've got a new idea for a commercial: 'This is Josh
Josh pays his taxes
This is the IRS, where a percentage of funds are taken from Josh's taxes and given to the government
This is the government, who gave Iraq billions of dollars in aid and military intelligence in order to win the Iran-Iraq war
This is Saddam Hussein, who used the aid in order to kill American soldiers in the Persian Gulf War
Tax money supports terrible things
If you pay taxes, you might too
'  Does this sound outlandish? It shouldn't, because, sadly, it contains far more truth then the commercials branding people who smoke marijuana as terrorists
Worse yet, another wave of commercials depicts 'potheads' in different scenarios, each playing out a different tragedy
In one, a car full of people smoking marijuana at a drive-thru, order food they can't afford
(And just who, exactly, is stupid enough to do this in broad daylight?) They realize they don't have any money and freak out, subsequently peeling out and driving over an innocent little girl
In another commercial, two kids are smoking marijuana in one of their parents' rooms
One of the kids pulls out a gun, but says it isn't loaded
Whoops! Looks like somebody got shot in the face
Yet another death avoidable if only they hadn't gotten high, right?  Finally, we have a couple of teenage kids sitting on a sofa
The girl hands the boy a joint and seemingly passes out
Then, he decides to lean over and sexually assault her (grab her breast, in this case)
In each of these cases, the camera fades out to the word 'Harmless?'  Now, as much as we all know that 'potheads' are a bunch of date-raping, child-murdering, friend-shooting, terrorist-funding communists who spend their spare time overthrowing the government, I'm beginning to wonder where, exactly, these ideas came from
If the U
government must insist on pouring billions of dollars into a 'war' that will never be won, no matter how much they sit around and make things up about marijuana, then at least have the decency to use a little thing we call 'facts
'  Nobody ever said marijuana was harmless
But you don't see any commercials with drunk drivers running over little girls, do you? Of course not
Yet this is an infinitely more likely scenario
So what happens when people begin to realize that none of these scenarios are based on anything even remotely resembling a fact? What happens when kids begin to realize that they know people who smoke marijuana and it doesn't make them bad people? When they realize people who smoke pot don't fund terrorism, or rape girls, or shoot their friends in the face?  We should no longer tolerate this flood misinformation and dishonesty from our government
They give Iraq and Afghanistan billions of dollars in aid and then act like it's a bunch of hippies' fault? C'mon, give us a little more credit than that
The next time the ODCP tells you that everytime someone buys a dime bag, they are supporting terrorism, who are you going to believe?
Today I started to remember a couple of books I read a while back which I would love to read again
I generally do not read books more than once, particularly if these books have had a positive impact on my life and also if I liked them a lot
For me the decision to rate a book, movie or CD as good or bad, largely depeds on my mood at the time that I read it, saw it or heard it
It is amazing that I am still able to listen to albums that I have owned for years and somehow fall in love with a totally obscure song within it
Movies are the same, and books as well
Nevertheless, there are books, albums and movies that for me, stand the test of time
If such items are able to transcend my moods, then these become favourites and are rated highly
An example of an album would be 'Crash' by Dave Matthews Band
An album that is musically and lyrically awesome
An example of a movie would be the entire 'Lord of The Rings' trilogy
I must say that those movies have spoiled me greatly!  An example of a book would be 'The Little Prince' - a book that always hits home
Just recently I read 'Veronika decides to die' by Paulo Coelho for the 2nd or 3rd time
I still find this book very good and enjoyable
And today, I was trying to remember the author of this book I borrowed from a friend a couple of years ago - it was titled 'Beauty'
Eventually i found it listed on Amazon
Its author is Sheri S Tepper
At the time that I read this book I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommended it to a few friends
I wonder if I still feel the same way
Similarly, when I make my journey back to the country of my birth in around 3 months I wonder what every thing will be like to me
Now I have almost 17 years of living a life in a new country that I love and revere - what will I think? I am sure that everything will seem so small and crowded in comparison to my new home but will I hate it? Will I fall in love again?    There are so many things I struggle to remember and some that are deeply and lucidly embedded in my heart and my mind
How will I cope? What will I do?  I cannot even begin to guess
Bad day, nothing went well 2day  'shut up'  didn' really expect that one, although i could imagine her saying that
today i look back, and yes, i've made many mistakes in my life, thought i was mature enough to take on the world, truth is, it's way beyond my grasp
i underestimated everything
It is more fashionable to be jaded about politics than to be interested in it
And, well, every third news story you see involves politics, be it the war in Iraq, the presidential race, or corrupt politicians putting another one over on the American people
I personally like to tune out all that rubbish, and just enjoy my life
Except, well, I can't do that
I love my country, I love my citizenship, and I am going to vote this November
My vote may not change the status quo, it may not alter the direction of the country, but it will be a statement
I am not afraid of the cynical truth about our government, and I am not afraid of trying to make a difference and failing
The only failure I can make is to not try
After making that statement, after voting for John Kerry and a change, I am going to go out, get some Chinese food and root beer, and plunk myself down on my friend's couch for a night of cringing and yelling at the elections on TV
I will have earned it--because if you vote Democratic in Texas, you have nothing to lose, and everything to gain
Down with the Shrub!
Well I finally got round to setting the ball rolling on this project
It only took one month to do so
There's only the bare minimum at the moment, or perhaps not even that considering the lack of photos
A short delay is expected before anyone can board the voyueristic train
Isle of Man Reported Stolen   James Smith, businessman from the Isle of Man, was dismayed yesterday when his flight back home from Gatwick was cancelled
'I went to the check in desk and asked for information
' said 25 year-old James
'They said they had to cancel the flight because they Isle of Man had vanished'  A Manx airlines pilot had discovered the disappearance of the 227 square mile landmass on his return flight
He then called over the intercom to the passengers that they would be diverted to Dublin instead, and free drinks were served by the stewardesses, in a reportedly 'carnival like atmosphere'
There was no wide spread panic at the airport, with only two members of the public requesting information
'Isn't there where they hold the TT?' commented one man
'Bugger
I guess it'll be Le Mans this year instead
'  The theft of the island and population of 76,300 has been reported to the authorities, who replied 'Yeah
we heard something about that
If you seen any sheep or branches of Pickwicks being held ransom, then please let us know
'   Before:    After:
That is the sound of time ticking away
I only have 14 days left in England before I have to go back to Egypt
Don't get me wrong, I am looking forward to returning to the sun, the heat and the karaoke, but I will miss my folks
Also going back means that work is about to start again
I teach Egyptian dolls and army boys how to read, write and count using the British curriculum
That means they know about Queen Victoria and Henry 8th but know very little about Egypt! I do look forward to getting my new class
The only question is: will they be the children I was told I would be getting at the end of last term? We will see
The Children go back to school on 31st August, but teachers return on 24th August so that we can prepare our classes
There will be many new teachers joining this year so that is kinda exciting
Hopefully they will be a fun-loving bunch and not members of the older (I mean OLDER) generation
Anyway, these next two weeks are mine
Even if it rains like it did today (not used to rain - it only rained three times in the last year in Egypt!) or if it is sunny, I will be partying in London and Brighton
Enjoy your life!

I feel as if is that time again, all students know what I'm talking about that feeling like school is around the corner
How every student hate the fact they are going to go back but also embrace it because they get to hang out with thier friend again
Well thats where I'm at
I don't want to head back to school but the lazing around is starting to get to me, I do the same things every day
I sleep in then wake up to cook breakfast for my brother and sister
Sometimes I hep my Dad with work others I watch tv and then I sometimes swim in the pool
When my parents get home we have diner and then we usually go for a swim around 9 O'clock
Then I stay up until 12:30+
So where is this all going and what am I getting to
well I don't know
Maybe it was the fact that I was glad my routine is going to be broken tommorrow as one of my best friends is coming over tommorrow maybe I just had nothing to write about
So here is a message to you Yuiichi bring mgs:tts, your laptop, Unreal 2k4, and
I dont know anything else you want
You probably already pissed that I keep reminding you but I'm just used to King Mericon forgetting everything
Lates,  Smog
I went to the gym
Bah, gym
However, since I went to lunch, I missed my usual gym lunch time
So after 45 minutes at the gym, Cindy and I hung out at her place for awhile
It started raining
She finished cleaning and we went back to Burton
We watched American Idol for awhile
that 2nd girl was gawd-awful
I hope the first Hawaiian girl wins
I agreed with Simon tonight
I don't even watch this show and I have an opinion
I collected a bunch of boxes from Cindy for my move this weekend (I have to pack Wednesday or Thursday) and headed home
I started a load of laundry, started planning the dinner party with Jake, Laura, Luke, Cindy and I and chatted with Jake some
He talked and talked and talked
blah blah blah (I told him I'd write this)
He really didn't have anything interesting to say
We talked about Rachael, his new place (He's living a full hour plus away from his job
Rach is 5 minutes walking from her job) and a variety of other topics
He just got back from a run and was soaking wet and tired
He laid on the floor and put his legs up and started wriggling in pain
Very weird
We talked about the blog and how we now have a loyal fan base (hi Laura, hi Emily, hi the 35 other people that read this every day)
He did say something moderately funny (I miss Cindy and our funny quotes): Jake: I don't want to get out of these wet clothes
they're so cold
Luke: Uhhh
that would be a perfect reason to get out of them
Jake: Not when I stand like this
(see picture below)   urlLink     We're going to play some video games now
My laundry is done
Talk to you tomorrow
not much going on
I think I'm sick again : (  I woke up in the middle of the night Friday night and my throat hurt SO BAD
so, yesterday after I got home from lab (when it wasn't any better) I said something to my Mom
She told me to try some Zicam spray
It tastes like booty, but I already feel like it's helping
It's that medicine that's supposed to shorten the length of the 'common cold
'  Hopefully it works
because I'm tired of being sick!    I have a fair amount of math homework to do today
I don't feel like doing it b/c it's Superbowl Sunday!  I'm not even rooting for a team, but I like football
so I wanna watch it
plus, I like the commercials and halftime entertainment
;)  I watched  urlLink Center Stage  again last night
I love that movie
It takes me back to my dancing days
I miss dancing
Maybe I'll throw some into my working out routine
It's good aerobic work and I enjoy it so it won't really seem like I'm working out
Well, I'm going to go
it's almost time for Sunday Dinner
We always eat early on Sundays
because of the karl and maggie show exposing trent lott's record, he is resigning from his leadership post
you're welcome, citizen
yeah, another layout
Anyone who wants cupcakes gets to come to church on Sunday
Otherwise they will be gone forever
of course its not like I'm never going to bake cupcakes ever again in my life
(By the way, I took some to Crockett park for my school friends and they got very good reviews
)   Anyway, I hate math
Please shoot me so that I don't have to do my stupid power point project on math
I hate it and I don't think that I could be more sarcastic on what I'm writing in it
It's way to amusing
when i saw this in the papers my first thought was, 'aba, idol si erap a
' then i got scared
president fpj
god forbid!    my officemate wryly commented, 'tell me who your frineds are, and i will tell you who you are
'  trite but true
What Wizadry Work
Wonderfully Woven
Wondering Who Wrote
I've also heard of another novel 'Gadsby'
seems the entire novel was written without using the letter 'e'
jax, any lights on that
Okay, I feel better now
So, back to reading St
Thomas Aquinas
That tends to always put me in a better mood
Yes, I'm behind my time
By about seven hundred years
{sigh}
urlLink The New Yorker : The US government is doing everything it can to keep new facts from public eyes about the abuse at Abu Ghraib
well here we are, 7 years later
i remember the night we met very well
you & Ma &amp; An  sitting outside on the terrace, waiting for me to arrive so you all could show me around the centrum on my first weekend in The Netherlands
I remember my Dad brining me to meet Ma, but since he didnt have a car to drive he had to call you to take us out
you know what?  im really glad he didnt have a car otherwise we never would have met
That you had just broken up with whatsherface that morning also proves true, im positive we were supposed to meet that night
i was physically attracted to you from the first moment we met & i remember asking you out at the end of that night, we went out the following wednesday and the rest is history! we shook hands, we played pool, i drank too much then we sat at the bar talking all night until it was time to leave
i sure did want to shag you
I never write anything really interesting in this blog
&nbsp; Lately it has just been a report of what happens to me every day
&nbsp; To tell you the truth, I really don't think it is all that interesting to record the minutiae of what happens to me every day
&nbsp; From now on I will try to limit myself to significant events that happen, or interesting thought that cross my mind
&nbsp; If you want to know what's really going on with me, you can email me or even call
&nbsp;   My friend at work made me a copy of his mixed CD
&nbsp; He is really proud of his CD creating ability
&nbsp; Granted, it is cool when you put together a mix that has just the right feel, and every track builds on the one before it to make it a cohesive piece, but its not like you wrote the music
&nbsp; I don't understand how one can take so much pride in putting together a CD, but he does
&nbsp;   I went to lunch with friends today
&nbsp; I had a crush on this guy at work a year ago, and I haven't seen him in months
He was at the lunch and when I looked at him and talked to him for a while I was mystified by the realization that I was ever even slightly attracted to him
&nbsp; What did I see in him? Maybe he's changed, maybe I have, but now I have no attraction to him at all
&nbsp; It is weird&nbsp;when you look back at the people&nbsp; you were interested in and you are completely confused by your old self's taste in the opposite sex
&nbsp; Ya know?  &nbsp;
Mullets, Nuts, and Crazies
Oh My!!!    A simple trip to the grocery store almost got us kicked out
Evermean and I went to Food Lion to grab dinner
Both of us were tired and delirious so we figured we'd get in and out
Didn't happen
I think we landed at the most disfunctional Food Lion in the country!  Okay so I'm just pushing the cart, minding my business when Evermean comes over falling out laughing
She's like, 'Girl
please look at dude's balls!'  I didn't wanna be rude so I waited a few seconds for fear of him catching me watch his crotch
But nooooo she kept screaming, 'Please!  Look at his balls!'  Finally, I looked in his DIRECTION, but couldn't find him because I spotted the worst mullet in U
history
This chick looked like Miss Ballbreaker from Porky's, but she had a dirty blonde, extra long in the back, deluxe cut mullet with a dubba wide head band
The freakin' bangs were all greasy and nasty looking
Plus she had on biker shorts
Evermean is still in my ear, so I go, 'Fuck his balls! HEADBAND HEADBAND MULLET HEADBAND!'  Bent all the way to the floor laughing at the dude with the ball issue, she looked at mullet lady and belted out the loudest, most ignorant laugh ever
So both of us are now cracking up in the middle of the store isle
So she's like, 'Stop saying 'balls' so loud
People are staring
'  At this point I'm sick of her mentioning this dude's balls so finally I get myself together and look dead at his crotch
This man had on some extra tight shorts and had on no underwear of any sort
His balls were literally giving camel toe, plus it looked like one was tryiing to creep down the leg part of his shorts and say hi to errybody
So I'm thinking  If this man's ball slides from unna dem shorts, Imma lose it!   We had to leave the isle cuz we couldn't stop laughing
We walked around the whole joint checkin to see if Saggy Balls Man's nut escaped
Meanwhile, Mullet Lady is justa cruising around the store, flicking her mullet around, throwing sweat everywhere
So yall know we were falling out laughing at this point
Finally we get in the express line
All of a sudden this crazy assed ol' black man yells, 'IS YALL IN LINE?!', clinching the holy fuck out of a Tootsie Pop
You read it right
That's all he had, an effin' Tootsie Pop
Main man was wearing a tight assed throwback, two sizes too small and a pair of elastic waist gym shorts pulled above his belly with a pair of dress shoes that had the backs cut out (ghetto slippers)
Then he had the nerve to have a blowout and big eyes
So then he looks at the old lady behind us and asks US, 'IS SHE IN LINE?!!!'  By this time, I'm like, 'I don't know
What do I look like the line spokesperson?'
Evermean fell out again
The lady in front of us was so embarrassed by our antics, she straight up got outta line
Worked for us
Tight Throwback Man just kept gawkin' at us and when he had to put his Tootsie Pop on the conveyer belt, why did he put two dividers on each side and look at us as if to say, 'DASS MINES!!!'  Of course, I had to be an asshole about it
I said, 'You wanna MAKE SURE nobody gets your Tootsie Pop huh?'  LOL  (like somebody wanted dat shit)
He just grinned and said, 'Well I aint want the lady to ring it up as somebody else's'
MMMMMKAAYY
Then I caught one last shot of Mullet Lady
OH MY GOD!!  She was with Saggy Balls Man!  Oh shit!  They're a couple!  Evermean and Nona  *flatline*  You woulda though we were on acid or something
That shit 'kilt' us
You mean to tell me that when Evermean kept on forcing me to look at this man's balls, Mullet Lady (that I was laughing at) was his wife?  OH LORD!!!!    We got the hell outta there and quick
Before they escorted us to the door
But before we left, we spotted a cashier that had a swooped to the side bush with about 15 miniature hair clamps in different colors
And she had the nerve to have exactly three naps on her neck
Perfectly shaped naps
I know a nap when I see one!  I had to square off on Evermean in the parkinglot after that
I can't believe she brought me to that place
Fuckin trailer park Food Lion
*random thought*  If he dipped his balls in chocolate would they be called chocolate covered nuts or BALL GRAVY?  Hmmmm
Ok, now if this works then I shall be very happy
NOW I'm going to sleep
I swear
I had forgotten about some homework, then I went online for a few minutes
ok, like 20 and then
well, now I'm going to sleep
I'm getting offline, and I'm GOING to sleep
No matter what!
Well, I always wanted to start one of these so here we go
Copped the new Mr
Hyde album today
Hyde has defintely improved on the mic since the early days and Necro's production is definitely still great, but I do prefer the production on Ill Bill's album
Although I do have a new favourite song which is from Hyde's album
Malignant Messiah has the craziest church organ beat I've ever heard
This week's wrestling wasn't too good
Raw was pretty lackluster and since they are leaning towards a Eugene/HHH fued I cant say I'll be on the edge of my seat
Smackdown on the other hand is getting better especially since they have the tag titles on London and Kidman
It's a pity London can't use his SSP since I think it's the best in the business but I had a feeling he would debut the 450 splash
Just the thought of stereo SSP/450's on PPV makes it worth buying
I really should get some new puro tapes though
Reading the results on the net doesn't do it for me and considering the G1 climax has started I think I need to stop spending money on xbox games
Speaking of which I finished Sudeki this week
With all the bad reviews it's been getting (gamespot), I still cant help but think this is a very good game
The fact that it isn't a traditional turn-based rpg like every xbox fanboy wants, makes it even better
The combat system was great and the background/area graphics were some of the best but as the reviews say the character detail is pretty bad
But all in all it was very enjoyable while it lasted
Also finished off Spiderman 2 and Legends of Wrestling:Showdown
Currently I'm playing Shadow Ops and Samurai Warriors 4 and also messing about with MTV Music Gen 3
Healthwise I went down to the pathology joint to get my foot checked out and to get a blood test but the fuckin place was chockers
I only lasted 20 minutes in there and left
Stupid bitch said I would be in and out in 20 minutes but what the fuck did she know? So I guess tomorrow I will get off my ass and get in there early to catch a stabbing and toe scraping
Signing out bitches
Well then
the mass for easter (i'm writing this late sat
early sun
morning) which i went to earlier tonight usually is not even near fun
two and a half hours of god
i dont mind church
don't get me wrong
i just get ancy as hell
sometimes i think i have a
but anyways tonight kicked ass b/c i went and i sat with my friend matt and his family
his brother was holding a candle during church
dropped it and burned himself then cried profusely
fun fun fun
then when his mom cried after people were getting confirmed, the kid who burned himself was like 'everyone look, mom's crying!' and his mom said 'he'll be crying after i punch him in the balls
'  ahh
classic church humor
technically it should not be allowed in church but we overlook these factors sometimes
then after church i went to allison's house
but got kicked out along with everyone else
but it was all good because alana and jen took me to sheetz
quite possibly my favorite hangout, where i bought a frapp
, altoids strips, and bagel
my night was then complete
and on a final note
HAPPY EASTER!
Wow, I don't think it's possible for you to find a trashier show
Posters Included  Here are some of the movies we've seen recently
The Day After Tomorrow, very cool
Lovely special effects, especially with the ice
It was a pity not to see the wolves chasing the little people then getting frozen, but you can't have everything I guess
Harry Potter, also very good (but very packed)
I love the Marauders Map, I wish I had one

Movie Review  I laughed
I cried
It moved me
It made me think about the perils of modern society and the bonds of family and friendship, as well as those bonds which transcend mere friendship and the families that we create by choosing our friends
The movie?  The Punisher
weird, I know
I'm totally not joking about any of it either
I really did cry
:p  I must be PMS'ing or something
But anyway
Go see it
It's very good
So, yeah, Ronald Reagan's dead
In 1984, we had an elementary school mock election
I knew that my mom was going to vote for Mondale, but that all my friends (and, it turns out, everyone else) were going to vote for Reagan
I stood in the voting booth for 10 minutes and changed my vote 3 times before finally going with the herd
I've been dreading Reagan's demise for awhile
Now, it's only a matter of time until Mt
Rushmore and the $5 are remade in his likeness
However, like Christmas, it seems that by living in San Francisco and avoiding TV you can escape almost any mass marketed phenomenon
I did see some CNN today
It was Anderson Cooper but without sound
The banner graphic at the bottom read as follows: 'Ronald Reagan Remembered - What to Remember
'    It's nice that TV wants to be so helpful
Meant to put this up yesterday as part of the [grid blog :: advent] but blogger wouldn't let me log on all day
Still here it is a day late
Song of the Wilderness (Advent)  The wilderness and the dry land shall rejoice, The desert shall blossom and burst into song  They shall see the glory of the Lord, the Majesty of our God
Strengthen the weary hands,  and make firm the feeble knees
Say to the anxious, 'Be strong, fear not,        your God is coming with judgement, coming with judgement to save you
Then shall the eyes of the blind be opened, and the ears of the deaf unstopped;  For waters shall break forth in the wilderness, and streams in the desert;  The ransomed of the Lord shall return with singing, with everlasting joy upon their heads
Joy and gladness shall be theirs, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away
Selected bits of Isaiah 35, from Common Worship
This is what we seek, this is the ancient promise
A world of balance, justice and peace
An Eden restored where the desert and wasteland become oases of life
A world where God is among us and we are with him
Its a dangerous dream that's been in our makeup since day one
How many have died, or killed for their version of a new Zion?  How many sacrifices, how many compromises? How much blood spilt how many tears shed over this dream
Surely this dream has been bankrupt by toil?  Surely I am naive, deceived or dangerous to still hold on?  I don't believe so
This was the promise that Christ the GodMan embodied
It was also a dream that came for him
It took him to the cross, the grave and then beyond
And now it has half come, that is not quite there
And so we go on, frustrated, wounded, tired, disillusioned
But dreaming
Will I let it come for me?  Is this truly what I seek?    Or shall I settle for a more mediocre vision

Did 47 minutes on the exercise bike last night
:-)  It really wore me out, and I kept my heart rate up the whole time
FYI -- was reading the Da Vinci Code at the time, and I realized it's not that good
Quite amateurish writing
But who am I to talk? At least he's published stuff
I also scheduled my fitness evaluation for Sunday morning! I will finally have some good body fat / weight stats, and I think they're going to measure my VO2 max also
As far as I know, I am around 190 lbs and 16% body fat -- not so horrible
But that's just an estimate
Anyway I would love to get down to single digits!  Last night for dinner I made grilled chicken breast on whole wheat spinach noodles, drizzled with olive oil, and lightly seasoned with salt, pepper and basil
It was delicous! Today I brought my homemade turkey sandwich and a couple Zone bars -- hopefully it will get me through the day
Lifting weights tonight on my way home from work? Possibly!

I am liberal
I'm a fuck the stupid fucking conservatives, with thier confederate flags and burning bibles, liberal
My heart bleeds, almost all the time, as you know if you ever read this blog
I was steadfastly against the war in Iraq, I still am, and I'm not ashamed; I have watched the reasons of the other side wither and die, be replaced, and die again
My stance hasn't needed to change, because it is based on humanist principles of compassion and forgiveness, instead of vengeance and anger
I do think that people who advocate war as a primary solution to a problem practice assertive ignorance, but I also think that people who believe all problems in the world we live in can be solved peacefully must live with both eyes shut most of the time
Basically what this boils down to is that you can't have black and white positions, which anyone who has even a modicum of perspective should understand already
A conservative's favorite counter-argument (and, in many ways, thier least effective one) is that if we don't like the country we can leave
And, as someone who has had this used on him many times, they always have a cute little smug glint in thier eyes when they say it, that they probably learned from thier task-master at Kamp, No
42 and 1/2
To be honest with you, they have a fucking point
There is no reason our country is in it's untenable moral position in the world right now except the willful dishonesty of the Right, and the apathy of the Left
Since I have no control over the arrogance of our conservatives, I will try to address the inexcusable absence of our liberal leaders from the national dialogue:  They are wealthy
They want to keep thier wealth and comfort
Slaves in other countries are different than slaves here, because we can't see them or smell them
And we have police to remove the homeless from our doorsteps
They give the money they make from investing in abusive multi-nationals to favorites like Red Cross and Greenpeace, in small installments or large chunks, depending on thier tax needs
They feel good about this
They think: there will always be problems, and poor people, and bad genocides  in other parts of the world  (until they're here), and so we should do what we can, but certainly not strain ourselves
And it's so much  easier  to just let other people, people better suited to that work, help these unfortunates
I don't know about you, but that didn't inspire me
And then again, I don't volunteer at the nearest shelter, or civil rights group
I don't even give them money
I don't make alot of money, either, but that's not so much relevant
Some of the worst off financially manage to volunteer a dozen hours a week
How can I judge when I'm guilty of the same things?  I can't
I can't teach them what to do differently either
What I can do, is try and alert them to thier hypocrisy, the hypocrisy of Western Society
Built on ideals that rejected the caste system so prevalent in other parts of the world, the colonists of eastern america settled into a comfortable relationship with thier slaves soon after thier revolution
There are still slaves, we just don't keep them in sight now
We live on wealth made possible by the work of billions of people, who make one of our paychecks in a year
Every time you purchase anything, or use any public services, or walk through buildings, realize that the quarry down the road sent its rock to India, while we got the stuff to build it all from Pakistan, because we make more money that way
And that the people working those quarries in Pakistan don't have unions, or pensions, or 401ks, like our miners
And that if they did start to organize, we would pressure the government to beat them down
And if the government wouldn't do it, we would replace them (we've done it before)
And if they started to get cozy with India, and they were going to start selling cheaper rock to them, we would probably try to start a war between them
That way, we can sell weapons to both sides!    Think about it everywhere you go, because that way, even if you don't volunteer or give up all the decadent wealth that Western immorality affords you, you can at least feel bad about it
And that's the best I have to offer you
Feel shitty, folks
Because you are standing on the faces of people you have never met, and don't want to meet
And let every decision regarding policy and foreign affairs that you make, and every vote, be colored by your guilt
guess i'm just lovesick again
finally bought my eleven minutes

(via  urlLink Allah ) Think  urlLink THIS  might come back to bite Teresa in the ass?  From the Newsmax article:    Just six months after the Sept
11 attacks, Teresa Heinz Kerry urged Americans to try to 'understand the roots of international terror,' while contending that the Sept
11 attacks were best viewed as an 'isolated catastrophe
'   Via NEXIS, the op-ed is titled:  KIDS STILL NEED HELP WITH SEPT
11 and deals with how to help kids understand the attacks
The relevant passage is:    We pray that one day we will view Sept
11 as an isolated catastrophe, triggering a successful world campaign to try to understand the roots of international terror as well as to work cooperatively to remove it
I'll let  urlLink John Kerry  say it for us all:    “Wasn't Teresa great? She speaks her mind
And she speaks the truth
”  Oh this'll be fun
jokes and remark directed at you in bad taste should deflected with good humour
this is one way to avoid enmity with anybody
losing your cool while playing the game will cause you to become strung up
you will forfeit a possible win
that will even spoil the pleasure of those watching the game
there is no way that you can change everyone in this world to your way of thinking
it is not even desirable
if everyone agrees with you the world will soon run out of ideas
there are many ways of correcting a person when he is wrong
by critscising blaming and railing at him in public you will be humiliating at him rather than correcting him one is certain to make more enemies through critiem
if you can show concern for a person with kind words, he will thank you for it someday
never use harsh or unpleasant words whenever you express your views on certain issues
diplomacy, gentleness and politness do not hurt anybody
in fact they will open many doors for more effective communciation
do not feel defensive when your own faults are pointed out
your fault are signposts for learning perfection
termper is a poor camouflage for shortcomings
when someone loses their temper, he will blurt out too many things which are better left unsaid
never reveal a former friend's personal secret, no matter how angry you are with him now
you will only degrade yourself in the process and others would neva acept you as a sincere friend thereafter
others will think that you could do them the same thing that you did to hurt a former friend, no one will trust you
I like balls
Anyway, Im back from Italy
Two weeks of rain, floods and all that shit
I went ot Trento, to visit my sister and her new child, Paola
One day my sister went out for some errands and left me alone with this two-week-old baby
Just after my sister left, Paola started crying
What do you do when a little thing like that starts crying? Where is the manual with the instructions? Didnt know what to do then I lied down, put her on my chest, with her head on my neck and we fell asleep together
It was the sweetest sleep

Oh yeah
Happy birthday, Psally
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yep
Been a while since my last blog
I wrote another long one a couple of weeks ago, and in the midst of trying to spell check, it got deleted
That's the thing about a blog
You can't respit things quite the same way
It's more of a release, and it typing it all over again would be like asking someone to throw up a meal that looks like it was never touched
gross comparison
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, of course as usual, a lot has happened
I'm MUCH busier lately
I started my actor's forum last week
It was very successful
We continued with our meeting today
It is something I formed for other actors to get together and critique each other
This way no one is being ripped of by a class that is just stringing them along
Here, we're brutal
If you're producing crap, we're not afraid to stop you in the middle and rip you a new a-hole
So far the response has been very accepted
But, I'm waiting for a few weeks when people start feeling personally attacked, and there are tears
It will happen
I'm just hoping everyone handles it as well as they say they will
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Romantically, I have healed
I think
LOL How do you ever really know? I met a guy named Edward at a 4th of July party I went to
He was very much my type physically
We hung out for a few days, and I started to notice that he was more analytical than what I liked
It was great for him because he thought about a lot of things most people wouldn't, and that I'm sure, made him a better person all around
I am all about anyone telling me at anytime what they think of me
I take in opinions, and I seriously consider everyone's input
But, I don't like it when someone &nbsp;as opposed to saying, 'I think you are
' They instead say, 'You are
It's okay to give someone an opinion of how you interpret them, but it is another to try to tell them who they are
I used to hate when I was 16 and people would say, you'll understand when you're 18, or 21
Those ages came, and you know what, I had the right grasp on the concepts early on
I think people are just threatened when other people grasp things earlier than they do
Oops, didn't mean to go on about that
LOL  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, anyway, Edward is this really wonderful guy
He would do almost anything for his friends, but I think he's still putting the finl touches on the masterpiece he's made of his life
We're going to be good friends
and coworkers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tanning salon was being VERY flakey
Calling me off more than I would actually work
And, the people there didn't exactly know their stuff
It's pretty bad when you have to look at the new guy to explain things to a client
After telling Edward about this, he suggested working with him at a hair salon in Beverly Hills called 'Jonathan'
I refused a few times because I wanted to be loyal to the tanning salon, but he insisted
And, I'm glad he did
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went in to interview, and keeping in mind this is an elite salon where a hair cut can set you back $400, I was a bit concerned about my complete lack of salon experience
Thank goodness I've been doing mine and friend's hair for 10 years now
I went home thinking I may not have got it, but was called later that day and I was working a couple days later
I worked 5 days in a row
MORE happy at this job than a few in a while
I wa actually a bit nervous as to what was expected of me, but I caught on
I am an assistant to the stylists there
I mainly do shampoos, and make sure guests are taken care of
Anything the&nbsp;stylists need; dryers, &nbsp;trays, color, I grab it for them
It kind of sounds menial
But, I'm just so happy to be working with really fun people that I can just joke around with, and seeing the same faces is really nice
I've missed going into work and not having the atmosphere and people change all the time
Daniel, one of the stylists, gave me a cut the first day
He styled it into an off center man-hawk
Hehe, it was very fun
It's not the typical thing I would do
I've never been allowed to with doing the acting thing
But, it is still stylable in a conservative sense
Alicia is going to do my color on Wednesday
It will be nice to get this stuff done by people I can trust
And the real topper is that they aren't charging me
How wonderful are they?  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will be working there 3 days a week
I found out that I am actually on salary
And, when I asked about a schedule, they made one up for me that only ha me working 5-7 hours a day as opposed to the 12 hour days I was happily putting in before
But even with the hour decrease, I still get the same salary
Hecks yeah! Plus tips!!!  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, yeah
My life may be able to be in order now
: ) The salon really saved me from a lot of worrying
There are still plenty of things I need to get caught up on
The cell phone still needs to be paid, and my car is doing more new fun things
But, at least I have a sense that I can be okay
I can afford my rent, and if I can get some photo shoots in, then I will be okay
: ) It's a nice feeling
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, Jason, if you're reading this
yeah, I still think of you
I wanted to come over, ring the buzzer, and just crawl in bed and hold you
But, that was at 4am
I'm happy
I'm here, and I finally have a sense of what I am doing
It's nice when you know yourself
But, it's great when you also know where you're going
God this is infuriating
The dipshit said this a while ago, but I just saw it again  urlLink here , headlining a very   anti-american   blog chronicling the dead from both sides of the war
'The story of what we've done in the postwar period is remarkable
It is a better and more important story than  urlLink losing a couple of soldiers  every day
'    Who said that? Representative  urlLink George Nethercutt  (R), the voice for my hometown in this nation's Legislature
Sickening
That's not exactly the  urlLink whole context , and he surely didn't intend it to be that   pointed
Regardless, I'm sure he meant what he said
This doesn't make him evil or a murderer, just blind to the fundamental flaws in the pro-war position
If you must fly on the eastern seaboard, avoid the Philly airport at all costs
In all the times that I've flown through there over the past 6 years, I daresay I've had one flight leave on time
They have no idea how to correctly direct air traffic, and like to leave planes circling overhead for upwards of 2 hours
Add bad weather into the mix, and you could be circling for years
Anyway, that out, onto the topic  du jour
I admit it
I'm a dork
I love linguistics
I love relating languages to each other and seeing how they develop
What I hate, however, are books on the topic that are so dry, dense and boring that they send me screaming to an issue of  Vogue  so that I can bask in its utter banality and look at the pretty pictures of pretty dresses
But I digress
I was in my  urlLink second home  the other day, and decided to pick up  urlLink  The Power of Babel  , by John McWhorter, assistant professor of linguistics at Berkeley
The back of the book looked really promising: In this entertaining romp through territory too often claimed by stodgy grammarians, McWhorter ranges across linguistic theory, geography, history, and pop culture to tell the fascinating story of how thousands of very different languages have evolved from a single, original source in a natural process similar to biological evolution
It goes on, but you can find it in a bookstore yourself and read the rest
The reviews also sounded really good, the words 'lively,' 'provocative,' 'fascinating,' 'entertaining' and 'witty' used liberally
Now, the fact that I fell asleep 6 times in the 4 hours I spent on this book probably had more to do with the fact that I was sitting outside in the nice Virginia countryside basking under a warm sun, than due to any shortcomings on the part of the book
Because the book is well-written, although personally I found it a little spastic, jumping around from subject to subject a little too quickly for me
I suppose it had to be suchly, because he uses a lot of languages in order to prove his points
Also, he uses footnotes to add personal opinion, which I found rather annoying
For example: 'Yes, I am concocting these terms for our purposes
If you really want to know, I am referring to something many linguists would call degrees of  anticausative prominence
124) Don't talk down to me, if I'm picking up your book it's because I want to learn something, I don't want to be treated like an idiot
Another example: 'Chimpanzees have always made me extremely uncomfortable
294) I'm sorry, I know now that if I ever meet you I won't mention chimpanzees
Why? What place do such confessionals have in a book on linguistics? Don't use footnotes to add more personal interjections to a book already filled with personal anectdotes
On the whole, for a book classified under the topics 'linguistics/science' it is rather good and much more accessible than 'popular' books on the same topic
But like I said, I'm a dork and I like such subjects
If you are looking for light beach reading this book is not for you
In a Kinko's in the middle of the night a man came in and asked me to color copy some $20 bills
I said
'No way, the FBI would come after me
' (It's actually the Secret Service that would I would later find out
)   He then proceeded to scream at me
'JOHN ENGLER IS MORE POWERFUL THAN THE FBI!!!'  And after a few of those I let me know he had to leave as I was picking up the phone to call the cops
He scampered out, but then stuck his head in a few moments later to give me a final one and then ran away
Whoo hoo! Jon's getting a prostitute! (just kidding!)   But seriously, I have thought about how many little gadgets and toys that I have and don't NEED in the sense that they are essential to survival
But, these toys sometimes make me a more efficient person
Cell phone, car, laptop
I wouldn't die if I lost these, but I would be a less effective person
I own a (as Shauna would say) 'million dollar bass,' but I use it for ministry
I could sell all I have and give to the poor, but I haven't felt God calling me to do that
I hope if I do hear Him say that I will answer
Carrie: I don't want to get in to the whole 'war' thing right now
Read my  urlLink old blog archives  for my opinion
You're right that welfare doesn't work, but we need  something  that will make a difference in these people's lives
Jesse: I have to  strongly  disagree with your post saying that Jesus is all people need
Yes, Jesus is the  most important  thing people need, but they have very real, very present, very physical needs as well
Even Jesus didn't offer Jesus without meeting people's needs
Look at  urlLink Mark 8:1
Jesus wouldn't send the crowd home without feeding them
Often Jesus' ministry centered on meeting people's physical needs
And look at James 2:14
What good is it, my brothers, if a man claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save him? Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food
If one of you says to him, 'Go, I wish you well; keep warm and well fed,' but does nothing about his physical needs, what good is it? In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead
But someone will say, 'You have faith; I have deeds
' Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by what I do
You believe that there is one God
Good! Even the demons believe that--and shudder
You foolish man, do you want evidence that faith without deeds is useless?  Hmmm
You said 'Maybe you think that sharing the gospel with someone without providing earthly 'needs' is hypocritical
I absolutely do think it's hypocritical, and the Bible teaches that it is, too
My best friend thinks I use the word 'friend' too easily
Too quickly
I take that to heart when I meet someone new, but sometimes, I let myself go and trust completely and love wholeheartedly anyway
And sometimes it is truly worth it
What's great is when I meet someone who thinks the same way!   urlLink Rich Villar  is a good friend of mine
Sure, I haven't known him long, but that doesn't matter
As  urlLink Fish  stated last night, 'This guy right here has enough heart to fill this room' and its completely true
He will out-love the best of them and his devotion and conviction is unwaivering
He is truly a man to love
To admire
Someone that everyone should try and emulate but will never quite get just as right as he has it
(except Steve, of course ;-))  I had never seen him on stage before and last night at  urlLink Acentos  he didn't disappoint
Everyone in the room was hootin' and hollerin' for him, and deservedly so
The guy can write a poem sitting at a traffic light!  And it will actually be good!!  He's so multifaceted it would take a lifetime to truly get to know him in his entirety
and that's alright by me
But all poetry aside, I love the guy because as much as he's got going on in his head, he will always be there for someone HE calls a friend
even if some don't deserve it
As another friend always says in regards to her devotion to me, 'I'm never too far from petty
'  Meaning, I'm always on YOUR side
Rich, I'm never too far from petty for you
Congratulations on a wonderful evening!  You were great!  :-)
the great canadian DE trek     So it looks like some of my fellow DE students (referring back to when I was actually a student) are discussing making a documentary about our linkers (which is what we call ourselves on the listserve we all belong to) by following a linker across the country and that linker stays a night with a linker in each of the provinces, and visit as many as they can along the way
It began with our buddy, Shane   urlLink the Hairy Hoser  talking about making the trek, then came the talk about me applying for a job up north and the mention that I would have to drive all the way to the North West Territories, so now there is talk of following me AND Shane for the documentary, which would be way cool
I just finished reading a book  Round Ireland With a Fridge , which was hilarious
It was about an English guy who bet his buddy that he could hitchike around Ireland with a bar fridge, and he did and wrote the book all about his travels urlLink Round Ireland With A Fridge    I would love to write a book about my travels, and across this country would be wonderful!    So I will give serious thought to my trek and WHEN I get a job up north, I will have to talk to my friends on the link about this trek!  I can't wait to meet some of them, although I have met more than a dozen of them over the past 7 years
All wonderful people, with the exception of a couple of troublemakers who shall remain nameless
great idear, huh?
nothing's gonna change my world        hello
i am going absolutely crazy
it's nasty and disgusting out and i have spent most of the day shuttling from one side of town to the other to pick up a change of clothes and feed my stupid homicidal fish
i have not completely discussed how much not having a job is fucking with my head
i feel like i have been hiding from my life by merit of the fact that i hung out with bishop the cat at matthew's house last week when he was out of town and that matthew is pretty much the only person i see on a daily basis
which i don't mind
i hope he doesn't mind me
but the point is that i feel this complete disconnection from a life that i pretty much followed for five years
i hardly see my friends anymore
my days are spent watching television and reading and i don't have any idea where to go from here
i feel like by merit of the fact that there is so little variation in what i do with my time i have become an incredibly boring person as a result
i want to be stimulated or challenged by something again, but i am waiting to have my third appointment with the department of voc rehab on friday and it would be stupid to go looking for a McJob in the meantime
so all i can do is wait, really
and walk
everywhere
and watch tv
and reread book for the five thousandth time
and shop for things that i can't afford
and be with matthew
i don't know
loneliness has set in with a vehemence that i have never experienced before
my biggest fear right now is that i'm going to transfer all this neediness on to matthew because he is the obvious host, being always around and all, and that he's going to get sick of me
not just matthew
i am afraid that when i see all my friends they're going to have the same perception--that i'm grasping at threads and not making sense about the root of my discontent
i never wanted to be this needy
i don't want my old life back
i just want to be able to somehow get a glimpse of what the new one, what the next phase, is going to be like and know for absolute certain that everything is going to be okay

Could she but have given Harriet her feelings about it all! She had talked her into love; but alas! she was not so easily to be talked out of it
The charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of Harriets mind was not to be talked away
He might be superseded by another; he certainly would indeed; nothing could be clearer; even a Robert Martin would have been sufficient; but nothing else she feared, would cure her
Harriet was on of those, who, having once begun, would be always in love
And now, poor girl! she was considerably worse from this reappearance of Mr
She was always having a glimpse of him somewhere or other
Emma saw him only once; but two or three times ever day Harriet was sure just to meet with him, or just to miss him, just to hear his voice, or see his shoulder, just to have something occur to preserve him in her fancy, in all the favouring warmth of surprize and conjjecture
Her regard was receiving strength by invariable praise of him, and her regrets kept alive, and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of Miss Hawkins's happiness
Have you ever been talked into loving someone other than the one you really wanted?   Harriet was one of those, who, having once begun, would be always in love
she was not so easily to be talked out of it
My wife did not come with me, so as expected, I got to church 15 minutes early
I left my daughter at the child’s room and I headed to the auditorium
Enjoying my solitude and taking advantage of the absence of people, I looked for a seat close to the stage and began to drift away
Without any notice, the musicians came out, I looked at my watch and it was still early for the service
They grabbed their instruments and began to play their music
The singer was not there, so I figured the musicians were just warming up
The drums, a bass, a saxophone and a piano opened the show
Soon afterward the guitar player appeared, he was a chubby white guy with glasses, he was wearing black pants and an extra tight black T-shirt
He stopped walking and stood still
Then, the pianist looked at him and gave him a sign with the head
The guitarist began to play
The chubby guy was just amazing
He was a genius with his instrument
The tunes, scales, and chords got more complicated and complicated by the minute; and with that, the music was getting better and better
I just couldn’t believe this geek looking dude was so darn great
I looked around to see how the people were reacting to the show in front of us
For my surprise, they weren’t even listening, they were talking with each other without noticing the great musician on stage
Santana, Slash, Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton would have loved to listen to this kid play
They would have probably learnt one or two things as well
The music was getting better by the second now
The guitarist at this time had his eyes closed and got lost in his own music
A minute later, he looked disturbed, like he was not breathing correctly
Next second, he jumped onto the center of the stage and start moving his whole body like he was possessed by his music
He let all the weight of his body fall upon his knees
He was still playing his guitar, but now he had an expression of pain on his face
The music became faster and louder, he was on fire
I looked at the rest of the band and they were playing without noticing the chubby kid
I looked at the audience once again and they were still talking with each other unaware of the magical performance
The guitar player could not hold it anymore, he was living the music; he threw away his glasses, ripped his shirt off and smash his guitar against the floor three times
He ruled
I stopped breathing for a few seconds
Then, I heard a voice from behind that said, “That was unbelievable
” I turned around and it was probably a fourteen-year-old kid who was trying to talk to his parents
They didn’t answer to him
He then looked at me and repeated his declaration
I nodded comradely without saying any words
WHat will thsi look like?
i swear my house is infested with flies
scary enormus flies that dont fly away when you chase them
they fly  towards  you! meaning that trying to kill the flies in my basement is a very frightening experience
cause they'll buzz past my ear with that sound that makes me crazzy! i just  finished vacuuming the basement and i noticed that there are tons of stains all over the carpet
its kinda sick
well my dad has been pissing me off in the same way bob has been pissing me off
and that would be giving me shit on who i'm friends with
like how i'm always with stevens group of friends
so i took like a 3 day vacation from that group of people to hang out with paulina,matt and so on
but then i get shit for that too
i dont get it
bob turns into an asshole bitching at me for hanging out with stevens friends
but when i bring a different group of people over i find bob ryan and steve hanging out with us
weird isnt it
i dont mind that they hung out with us why do they have to care when i hang out with them??? then i get shit for hanging out with steve and them cause they're older than me
well even if i go hang out with paulina shes older than hank plus theres 19 year olds with us
people need to stop worrying about who i'm hanging out with it really pisses me off
god fucking dammit
well this fly is giving me hassle too
it'll fly into the computer room make me chase it around the basement and when i retreat back to the computer it'll fly in and out again
its messing with me!

Couple of points: I for one wasn't making any statements about museum-worthiness, I was just trying to fucking REMEMBER, period
Nonetheless, I do see the similarity in that we are collecting stuff primarily from another era, one that has to be dead or else it would still be the same era as now
I think we do all have the sense that something's gone, and we can say THAT without saying that nothing now is interesting or that today's a complete void
More interesting, though, is the question of whether or not our 20something selves would've seen this endevour as silly
I'm inclined to say that yes indeed, we might have skittered away from it claiming something like inherent goofiness in the project
We might have blogged about something, but not about ourselves
I think as a whole we were extremely documentation-phobic, which is why there's a need to put the blog to its current (obstensible but forgiving) purpose
I see that phobia as really a kind of self-consciousness, the exact kind of inability to take ourselves seriously enough to feel like all this stuff is worth documenting that I was talking about in the my very first post
I see that rearing its head still in a tiny way here; I just think that's an interesting finding
Almost a determination to seek self-effacement, in stark opposition to the All-American quest for noise and lights and un-earned kudos and big paychecks and 15 mins

NO PASSION IN FRANCE?   It seems there's a theater chain in France that's refusing to show 'The Passion of The Christ' because, as a Mr

Aren't terrorists only supposed to be attacking people who helped out America in Iraq?  You mean to tell me these cowards don't care who they attack?  I'm shocked
I thought only America and it's allies were targets of terrorists
People across the world need to wake up, take their rose colored glassed off for a second or two and see these people for who they really are
They don't care who you are, American, French, Spanish or Arab, if they can attack you they will
The Only Thing Necessary For Evil To Triumph  Is For Good Men To Do Nothing
Lets see this one is going to be about yes, about scum
Better, about the Scum of the Scum
About the Scum of the Scum
SECRETARY OF Defense  Donald H
Rumsfeld  yesterday described the abuses of Iraqi prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison as 'an exceptional, isolated' case
At best, that is only partly true
Similar mistreatment of prisoners held by U
military or intelligence forces abroad has been reported since the beginning of the war on terrorism
A pattern of  arrogant disregard  for the protections of  the Geneva Conventions  or any other legal procedure has been  set from the top ,  by Mr
Rumsfeld  and senior U
commanders
The foundation for the crimes at Abu Ghraib was laid more than two years ago , when Mr
Rumsfeld instituted a system of holding detainees from Afghanistan not only incommunicado, without charge, and without legal process, but without any meaningful oversight mechanism at all
Brushing off his violation of the Geneva Conventions, Mr
Rumsfeld maintained that the system was necessary to extract important intelligence
But it was also an invitation to abuses -- and reports of those abuses have been appearing since at least December 2002, when a Post story reported on harsh 'stress and duress' interrogation techniques bordering on physical torture   2004 The Washington Post Company
In class this morning, we translated the first two paragraphs of an academic article that seemed like it was eventually going to be a cautionary tale about the devastation of globalization
It's hard to tell after simply two paragraphs, but the style of the piece and the use of an obscure African proverb are pretty good clues a la Ginzburg about where it was heading
Save two of us, myself included among the two, no one could understand the selection as it was written in pretentious academic prose, the kind all of us should be aiming for
One classmate claimed that she never wrote like that and had no intention of ever doing so
I replied, 'You just need more professional development
'  Is it strange that the entire class found this funny but that no one else outside of graduate students in the liberal arts will ever see the humor in this? Is my mind expanding or contracting as I further my education?
Another day has almost come and gone Can't imagine what else could wrong Sometimes I'd like to hide away somewhere and lock the door A single battle lost but not the war ('cause)  Tomorrow's another day And I'm thirsty anyway So bring on the rain  It's almost like the hard times circle 'round A couple drops and they all start coming down Yeah, I might feel defeated, I might hang my head I might be barely breathing - but I'm not dead  Tomorrow's another day And I'm thirsty anyway So bring on the rain  I'm not gonna let it get me down I'm not gonna cry And I'm not gonna lose any sleep tonight

Enum    urlLink ENUM  is a protocol that is the result of work of the Internet Engineering Task Force's ( urlLink IETF 's) Telephone Number Mapping working group
The charter of this working group was to define a Domain Name System (DNS)-based architecture and protocols for mapping a telephone number to a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) which can be used to contact a resource associated with that number
ENUM was developed as a solution to the question of how network elements can find services on the Internet using only a telephone number, and how telephones, which have an input mechanism limited to twelve keys on a keypad, can be used to access Internet services
ENUM at its most basic is the convergence of PSTN and IP networks; it is the mapping of a telephone number from the public switched telephone network to Internet functionalities
ENUM enables Internet-based users to make a selection from a range of services available for communicating with another person when the caller knows only a telephone number or has access only to a telephone keypad
ENUM allows users to access Internet-based services and resources from Internet-aware telephones, ordinary telephones connected to Internet gateways or proxy services, and other Internet-connected devices where input is limited to numeric digits
ENUM enables users to specify their preferences for receiving incoming communications, and gives greater user control over communications
For example, a user can specify a preference for voice mail messages over live calls during certain times of day, or may indicate a destination for call forwarding
The potential applications of ENUM are far-reaching; however, the principal applications for ENUM have centered on two areas
One is Voice over IP (VoIP) and the other centers on Voice Protocol for Internet Mail (VPIM)
The long-stated goal of the VoIP industry has been to make a phone call over the Internet as easy to make and as high-quality as a regular PSTN phone call
The goal of the VPIM industry has been to develop a comprehensive mechanism by which voice mail systems could exchange messages over IP networks
ENUM enables carrier and enterprise voice mail systems to find each other, interoperate, and exchange messages
Although VoIP and VPIM are the most widely discussed applications, other application possibilities for ENUM, including but not limited to Internet Fax and Instant Messaging, exist
ENUM has started user trial registrations
I have already got mine :-)

I'm walking in the city this morning and just passed the BPL
Even though I have some complaints about living here, it is sentiment like the above(which is carved into the stone structure of the BPL) that makes me happy to live in this city and in this nation
It is easy to forget the tremendous opportunities available to us as free people
I make it a point to remind myself as often as possible just how fortunate I am in comparison to the majority of other people around the world (even though I still make jokes about being a poor artist, I realize that this is only in relation to the standard of living here)
We are and come from people who chose to risk everything for freedom, for eqality, to live life on their own terms
I am proud of this heritage
We are the land of the free and the home of the brave and I, for one, hope we always remain so
Embarking  In about an hour's time I'll be on my way to Flinders, in the Mornington Peninsula area for an overnight camp/retreat/intensive with the rest of the community

I got a frantic SMS from my mum today, read it disbelievingly, then called her back immediately, only to hear the distress in her voice
She sounded like she'd be crying, and rightly so I suppose
We just found out my closest Aunt, on my Dad's side, has been declared (and I  HATE this word) brain-dead
Brain-dead
Almost a cliche
Like a sufficiently melodramatic phenomena constantly portrayed in a daytime soap opera or Channel 8 serial
She's on life support right now, and I don't have the full details, but suffice to say, I'm shocked
I had no idea this was coming
Her cancer's been in remission for awhile, and I'd never known that she'd been in-and-out of the hospital over the last couple of months
This was sudden
Bringing up her name always conjured up images of love, warmth, and fantastic food that we'd always enjoy at her place during CNY
And though we only ever saw each other during my trips home in the Lunar New Year period, we've maintained a certain sense of closeness, I feel
I'd anticipated meeting up sometime during my trip back in December (even during CNY again if possible), or if not, at the wedding in April, but now
I don't know what I feel
Close, yet distant
Worried, anxious, helpless, yet
not quite believing it
Not quite coming to terms
Maybe my mum's message was wrong
Maybe it was a 'she  might  be brain-dead' kinda thing - mum often leans towards theatrics, it run in my family
We'll just have to wait and see
Maybe I'm wrong
Hopefully
Prayerfully
Uncomprehendingly
Hi All
Just thought I'd post on progress on my (Not-So)Shapely Tank(or Tee)
As I mentioned before, I'm not doing the waist shaping due to the fact that I no longer have one
So for me it's been straight knitting up to the underarms
I've now made it to the split for the two shoulders, so maybe in a few days the back of my Shapely will be done
I'm treating the back as sort of my test swatch, so once I do the front I'll feel more confident that I've got the short rows right
And I may be knitting the sleeves
That decision will come once I have the two pieces done & decide how much of my arms I don't want to see
But I'm really enjoying this!

urlLink Indymedia  this is  the  independent news source
tons of stuff from ordinary people all over the world

very good
urlLink anti-war blog
not much more to it than that  urlLink AMERICAblog: Because a great nation deserves the truth   Ummm

my first blog on here was mac whatever for mac stuff, and i put loads of news about mac stuff on there, i mean i use a mac all the time, and get tons of news and updates sent to me via email, plus i was on dotmac too, and in a couple of mac yahoo groups
but i had a change of heart
i deleted the entire blog
why? i realised i was advertising apple products by doing this
and there are plenty of websites with apple news, apple stuff for sale now
so why repeat it?  at first i thought, i would put it on a blog so it would be info for me to check back to
eg all the mac websites i visit
news that i saw that seemed important
but now i haven't been going on those sites, nor am i reading the apple emails i get
nor am i trying out new applications
or going on mac
com even though i have a subscription
so why bother with a mac blog with news on if i don't really care about most of it, and it's irrelevant to me
it all got deleted
then after i did that, my friend said to me, omg where's your mac whatever blog?  i though no one else read it
i said i had deleted it due to lack of interest
lack of interest on my part that is to just repeat what i got in emails
which are mostly ads let's face it
so are the online mag articles, really it sums up to free advertising
next i'll get a t-shirt with apple on you know
buy a t-shirt and walk around adverstising the product
look i should get paid for wearing a company's logo, it makes me and anyone else who does it a walking billboard
and i paid to be a billboard? nuts isn't it?  but my pal said that was a good name
mac whatever, put it back
so i did, and i try to put just opinions or rants i suppose on there, okay there's some dumb info, and a little news, but i can't promote something like that
i mean especially when i am so angry that so many things are mac incompatible
and my mac has been much better without all that updating and mucking around
happy mac now

I am sorry to report Raunchsters, that I have been very ill
I am still very ill, I am just ignoring it now
I have bronchitis and the mother-of-all-sinus infections for which I have my third doctor's appointment tomorrow
Know why?  Because they think I have a deviated septum
Know how they want to fix it?  They want to break my nose and then re-shape it in a new fun way
I am opposed to this because my wedding is in less than three months and I would like to keep my nose on my face for that one day of my life
I told them they can go ahead and operate on my nose as soon as I get home from London, with no bitching from me
Until then
I suffer
On the plus side, I lost eight pounds last week without even trying
Well today is my birthday and I actually have nothing to say
no one is even at home right now
other than my brother and he didnt even know that I was awake until my dad called
and then he didnt even come down stairs to wish me a happy day
so you know what?? he can have it in his ass
well anyways before I go talking smack about every person I know I think that I need to stop
sorry y'all
I cant pretend to be all happy and cheerful when no one could care less about me
I'm a big ass baby
someone come over here and punch me in the face because I am ridiculous

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As most of you know, my cat was taken to the Humane Society last Monday--July 12 before I went out of town to Gulf Shores
&nbsp; I thought it was taken care of
I mean, I didn't like the idea of taking it there, but I really had no other Humane way of taking care of it
&nbsp; Afterall, that is why the Human Society exists
&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, I am going to bed Sunday night and I get a phone call at about 9:30 and it is my neighbors' daughter in law who also happens to be on the board of directors at the Humane Society
&nbsp; She calls me and begins cussing me and harrassing me about putting my cat to sleep
&nbsp; She is upset and basically, I said 'mam' I don't have to take this!' and I hung up the phone
&nbsp; I was so upset
&nbsp; NO ONE has ever spoken to me like that before
&nbsp; She was out of control
&nbsp; I finally think it is over
&nbsp; I go about my business
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, Monday morning, she calls again this time blocking her number so I don't know who it is
&nbsp; She continues to pound me and ask for info because she is trying to track down this cat
&nbsp; I told her that I would have been happy to have given her that information the night before if she had spoken to me like an adult
&nbsp; Then, I call to see if she left a message on my answering machine and she says, ' I like the 'God Bless
'&nbsp;(with sarcasm) You put your cat down last week
&nbsp; Nice Going
'&nbsp; I am soooo upset
&nbsp; She has no right calling me up and harassing me about using something for the purpose it was intended
&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this what board members do to all who drop animals at the shelter, or does she just think she can pick on me because she thinks I am a young person who won't do anything about it?&nbsp; Is this how a board member should represent an organization that they are a part of?&nbsp; If you feel so strongly about something, you shouldn't be a part of something that goes against your values
&nbsp; She was out of control and overstepped her bounds
&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For you all that know me, I'm not one to complain at a restuarant, for service or anything like that
&nbsp; I am usually the one to grant the benefit of the doubt, but I am going to complain to the chairman of the board of directors and let them listen to my answering machine message
&nbsp; This was not a professional conduct
&nbsp; It's just a cat, people!!!!!

I must to the batcave to see how that works so I don't lose my money

Gotta send them to the airport, so, it will be two weeks straight not going to Youth meet church
Can someone reserve a copy of last week's teaching by Ps Tamil
I really would love to know what he has to say about what you typed
:)    I'm having my holidays now, for 3 weeks
but there's 1 or 2 days I need to go back school for presentation and another BM test :P I'll be sleeping alot, and TV-ing and Internetting and doing the things I missed since I got into this exam pressure thing
I think I didn't pass one of the papers, Semiconductors
Just hoping for the best!    Cya guys next week! Take care ;-)
urlLink Email   urlLink     But a few random things first
--Just helped some buddies shoot a movie
The short film was called  Morning Sickness
Check out all relative information at  urlLink Ice Nine Productions
I played a homicidal maniac and got to kick the sh*t out of someone
I'm not kidding
The shoot was great, Drew and Tim are cinematic geniuses, and hopefully they'll let me into this summer's Feature Length Film  13 Inches
And yes, it  does  refer to  that
And no, it's not about me
Go to the site and read about it
There might even be a picture of my sorry ass up there soon
I want to talk more about it but I'll have to devote an entire thing and it's just best if you check out the f*cking website, for Christ's sake
-- American Idol  is a joke this year
Thirty thousand people audition and they can't find 10 who are dynamite singers?  There are about two that have the talent of the people from the first two years and no one even approaching a Kelly Clarkson, from whom, by the way, I am still awaiting a phone call
OSCARS 2004   Since I forgot to post my Predictions for this year, I'll just have to be honest and put who I thought would win in parentheses next to who actually did in all the major categories
I would have been dead, stupid wrong on at least two for reasons that should have been clear to me
Here we go:  Best Supporting Actor: Tim Robbins (Benicio Del Toro)--Benicio is well-loved in Hollywood because he's picked absolutely all the right roles in the last few years, which should help forgive the transgression of  Excess Baggage
Anyway, you figure the guy is due
I just thought he would have been stronger than Tim Robbins
But Timmy pulled it out
I'd like to say thank you to Mr
Robbins for not getting all political in the speech, and in fact saying something rather poignantly benign, if there is such a thing
And I have to mention this: when did Susan Sarandon get hot again?  She had like a ten year period where she looked like my grandmother
Now she's back
Good for Timmy
Best Supporting Actress: Renee Zellweger (Renee Zellweger): I've said it before and I'll say it again--Renee looks incredible with that little extra bit of weight on
When she goes Ethernopian it ruins everything
Now if we could just her to open her f*cking eyes, we would really have something here
And she's banging the dude from the White Stripes, which once again proves my theory that I need a band
Best Song:  Into the West  ( A Kiss at the End of the Rainbow ): OK, this was the first year that I thought all of the songs were tremendous
Just fantastic, all of them
But the song that one was by far the worst of the bunch, and I'm saying even though I hated the way that chick spilled out a ramshackled Version of the song from  The Triplets of Bellville
But the two songs from  Cold Mountain  were astoundingly good
Best Screenplay (Original):  Lost In Translation  ( Finding Nemo ): Here's where The Academy blindsided me with something I should have seen coming all along
If the final Lord of the Rings had not been in this year's category,  Lost in Translation  would have won for at LEAST Best Director and probably Best Picture
Clearly LOTR deserved every award it got and then some--that I'm not disputing
But here's a stupid thing The Academy does: since they can't give Sophia Coppola either of those two awards, they get her in on the only other thing she was up for so as not to stiff the Indie Favorite
Usually that's OK, but my God, the script for LIT wasn't even a factor!  The script was bearable at best but was made so great because of performances
So this one pissed me off as it robbed a really great script of a well-deserved award
Best Screenplay (Adapted):  Lord of the Rings  ( Lord of the Rings ): Duh
Though if you haven't seen  American Splendor , do it NOW
Best Director: Peter Jackson (Peter Jackson): Double duh
Was there any question with anyone, seriously?  I will say this, however: clearly, they were waiting until the last one came out to award this, and that's OK
But it wasn't ALL the director
Doesn't anyone find it interesting that not a single actor in ANY of the three films got a nomination?  Not Elijah Wood, not Ian McKellan, not Vigo Mortenson
No one
Best Actress: Charlize Theron (Charlize Theron): This one was out the door months ago
A done deal since  Monster  was released
I bet Stephen Jenkins is looking at Michelle Branch right now and rethinking his choices in life
Best Actor: Sean Penn (Bill Murray): Remember the whole thing with Sophia Coppola and the Screenplay?  Well, this is one I figured on happening and it didn't
Alright, Sean Penn is f*cking great
We can all admit that
Insanely underrated actor by the public at large
Should have won last year for  I am Sam
Maybe he threw down a better performance
But I don't think so
And for f*ck's sake, why the hell  wouldn't  you give it to Bill?  Sean Penn is going to continue to command demanding and dramatic roles and be up for Oscars again
This will be the only chance Bill ever gets to win one
He's got an incredible body of work the whole way from  Saturday Night Live  up to  Lost in Translation , in which he was absolutely and totally brilliant
I suppose I'm happy for Sean Penn, but I am literally heartbroken for Bill Murray, who really wanted the award
Sean Penn doesn't even show up for the Oscars 99% of the time
This has me really pissed
Give the guy the credit he has deserved for years
God I'm mad
Best Film:  Lord of the Rings :  I mean, c'mon, duh
So there you have it
In conclusion, my Top Five Hottest Women of the Night:  5
Nicole Kidman--Too tall for me but she always looks perfect
Renee Zellweger--See above comments
Angelina Jolie--Dear Sweet Christ in Heaven, help me
She seems to be getting back to normal after the whole Billy Bob thing, and it's always nice to see her dress classy
Diane Lane--Oh Heaven Help Me
How can you be that hot at age 40?  I don't understand
More importantly, why in the Name of Joseph is she marrying Josh Brolin?  Why?  This once again proves that I need a
wait, no
This one just proves that the world is not fair
Catherine Zeta Jones--F*ck me running, every time I see her she is somehow more gorgeous
I honestly think I might urinate in my panteloons were I to ever get within five feet of her
G*ddamn
And for the 4,792, 991st time, Go Straight to Hell Michael Douglas
Sleep is a beautiful thing
For the first time in weeks I have caught up on my sleep and you have no idea how happy that makes me
So now that I'm mildly coherent I'm going to do a rather large disorienting post
Election's Wrap Up  17 hours of hell
That's what it was
I LOVE people who happen to have their voter information cards
It says directly on the front of them 'Keep this card
It will give you quicker access to your polling station,' so don't start bitching at me when I make you get in line to figure out where the hell your voting
Cranky voters suck and from what I understand, given the volume at our station and given the amazing abilities of my information officer and poll staff, we had the most efficient location in Edmonton-Strathcona, so if you don't like it, bite me
There's my rant about voters done
On to scrutineers
If I ask you to do something perfectly reasonable, like, oh, let's say - DON'T GO BEHIND THE VOTING BOOTH!?!? Then maybe, just maybe you shouldn't be back talking to me, especially considering that I can so easily punt your ass out of there
Other than that and a few other minor incidents, the scrutineers were well behaved and well trained
Kudos to the parties on that front
Finally, Elections Canada really fell down in two areas
Training for poll station staff and voter registration
Now as a caveat before I rant about this one, those of us in the riding offices did the best we could given the resources and time we had
The revising agents worked like madmen and I can tell you for a fact the recruitment and training session lost their minds
BUT seriously - why the fuck wouldn't the manual include a comprehensive section on closing the polling station and counting??? Did buddy who wrote it just give up at the end!? It was beyond pathetic and at the end of a VERY long day you don't want to piss off the poll station staff even more by not telling them what to do
On the voter registration front, given that they knew and election was coming, why the hell didn't they advertise the mobile stations better considering that returning office was in the middle of no where? It's beyond me
All in all it was a definite learning experience
I take back what I said about the returning officer
He is old, but if you can still pull of an election with relatively few hitches, especially compared to some ridings at 80 years old, you deserve appreciation just for that alone
Not sure if I would give it another go any time really soon, but for some reason I think I'm addicted to elections
My Normal Life  So I'm interviewing with NATO at 06:30 on Monday
I have yet to receive a formal acceptance letter from the Faculty of Graduate Studies at Western
I know it's a rubber stamp situation because the Poli Sci Dept doesn't recommend people without knowing the funding is there, but still, what if something freakish happens and the FGS doesn't send that letter? I'm going to need a fall back position
Hello NATO
I can't even remember what I put in my application
I hate phone interviews - they're no where near as effective as face to face
At any rate the position is as an assistant in the Public Diplomacy Division in Brussels with the Canadian Liasion Officer and damn I want to do it, but I know grad school is the smarter long term decision
Other than that life is finally normal again
I've started looking for places to live on the net in London
As soon as I get the formal letter I'm booking a flight down there over the August long weekend to find a place
I've printed off the course load for the MA in Poli Sci program and while it's intense, I know I can handle it
I've also taken out a few books from the library on various Middle East topics because I desperately need to brush up
So apart from staying in my PJs all day, I'm going to clean my apartment and get some reading done
Just the kind of Saturday I was looking forward to
• coffee prices went up $0
11 at dunkin' donuts
what a rip
• my body still feels numb
• being unorganized
• bryan
• work
• feeling broke
• missing paul
• the wedding is still happening
• my puppy has to have surgery
• wanting to move out of my house
• political ignorance
• orange tootsie pops
• craig's stupidity
• money
• mom & dad
• doing other people's dirty work
• myself
urlLink     Which Silver Screen Siren are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    hmm
wasn't bette davis the scary sister in  whatever happened to baby jane?
sounds about right then!
Something funny:  At a graduation party, sitting on a futon
To the right is a couch, and to the left is open space
There are three people on the couch
Three people in the open space
Both having completely independant conversations
I am in the middle, in neither of the conversations in particular
Simply listening
it was
confusing
To the right is a debate about the tragedy of life and the validity of relationship itself, and to the left is a distorted conversation debating about penises and other rather interesting body parts
Just funny to sit in the middle, not knowing whether to laugh or cry
I laughed
Something serious:  Outward appearances versus feelings
Good god
In the words of Scott, 'I didn't even know there were people like this in the world
' How can you be this happy-smiling-outgoing person on the outside, but then transform into this protective shield of a person that can't even decipher their own feelings
I dunno how to deal with it
Not going to even go into it
This wont even make sense to most people
Story of my life      ---------- PS: Sleeping is great
I hate when people abuse thier body for school work
Man, I hope all you IB kids take like a 5 day nap!

only ur's                                          *****  (n
b-i've typed everything & not used copy,paste method)
So I was drivin home tonight and i realized something pretty cool
this whole time i've been thinking that whitney gets back next wednesday, but i realized that wednesday is the day that she LEFT, so the 9th is actually next monday
so that was a cool surprise
like finding money in your coat pocket
like i should've known that, but didn't think of it at first
yep, anywho
i've seen 4 movies in the last 3 days which is pure crazy
hmm, what else
yeah, i'm trying not to duplicate what tim put in his blog cuz we did the same stuff today
marie's cool to hang out with
she's like one of the guys, just with really long hair ;)
man, i have spent so much money lately
i'm kinda try to slow down
what exactly it is i'm saving for is beyond me though
well, i'll try to update tomorrow
buenas noches
I made the mistake of sleeping very late last night
Well, my plan was just to ride roller coasters until lunch, have lunch, watch Shrek II after that, and then just go home
I forgot that when one goes to Berjaya Times Square, one's basically doing a  lot  of walking
I forgot that when one goes to KLCC on a Sunday to watch a movie, you have to deal with a  lot  of people
I also forgot that when a day turns out good, people tend to want to prolong it as long as possible
So, I've been out of the house from 9a
until way past 10p
, on about three hours' sleep
I am  exhausted
But it was all worth it, because today was a very satisfying day
Well the final was today, greece beat portugal by a solitary goal
Figo and company should've done better
much better, the outcome was least expected
Ab ovo the bookmakers odds were 80-1 against Greece and voila they are the champs of europe
I hate the Gain corporation and all of the evil corporate greed they stand for
You fuckers have fucked up my computer with your goddamn pop up ads and dodgy toolbars that insert hardcore sexual stuff on a computer shared with my 12 year old daughter
I would never willingly click on a goddamn popup, what makes you think I want my PC bombarded with irrelevant shit that inhibits my use of my own software, locks up my windows explorer window and basically kills my enjoyment of the internet? You are all idiots, and I would gladly light the match that burns whatever back alley building you creatures infest to the ground
So yeah, guess what I did this weekend
I edited registry files and ran spyware cleaners and I still have this crap on my computer
This should be illegal
Really, because it's intrusive, inhibitive and just plain irritating as hell
Oh and then when I came to work today, the other chick in my office suddenly had the same problems
Just out of the blue
She wasn't doing anything she shouldn't have been doing, hadn't downloaded anything for some time
Just *boom* she's got 50 popups all over her screen and desktop shortcuts she didn't add etc
So now, we've had to call the IS department to take time from them to come and fix it, meanwhile she's unable to work because they're on her computer fixing everything
Productivity loss
Is there a valid petition or bill going through congress right now I can sign and support? This has pissed me off no end, if you couldn't tell
Whenever she sees raining She falls down crying On her knees All alone in the Dark Crying her heart out  She wishes you were there With her, in her hour of need To hold her And love her  Whenever she sees raining She falls down crying On her knees All alone in the dark Crying her heart out  Her heart broken No longer with you On her knees She cries   Whenever she sees raining She falls down crying On her knees All alone in the dark Crying her heart out  She sees you in her mind And thinks of the love she shared with you No more it can be Her hand on the trigger of her heart  Whenever she sees raining She falls down crying On her knees All alone in the dark Crying her heart out  Crying her heart out Crying Crying
I just finished reading President Reagan's speech for Barry Goldwater in 1964
The transcript is:  http://www

asp  This is probably one of the greatest speeches ever presented
It is called, 'A Time for Choosing
'  If you have an interest, more of his famous speeches are located at:  http://www

You wish
Your  naive  thinking
Just when you thought you were really doing your best to be understanding, to give him the space and time, he hurts you
Hurts you like splinters in your feet
You feel the sudden tightening of your heart
You wish he wasn't speaking the truth
But he is
It's an unspoken promise
You two will never lie to the other
You'd be open and trusting
He sure is open
At the times he feels like it
He'd open the stitches from your heart
Thread by thread  he  yanks  and  tugs
He doesn't seem to hear your cry
Or perhaps, he really doesn't care
Not anymore
Not after the way you've hurt him
You've hurt him deep
He'd never treat you the same
No more
You went too far
All his tears, all his promises, were nothing but lies
Lies to keep this naive bitch like you
You waltzed right into him palm
His palm, not his heart
You asked if he wanted this, no says no
Your back turned, he take it
And you two aren't even married
He's tired of you
He doesn't want your company
He doesn't even want your body anymore
He wants time away from you
I've to do some house errant he says
I've something on, I just can't remember what it is
Oh,  go look for your friends ! I've found my company
He'd stay out late no matter how tired he is, with people
Anyone but you
What can you do? Nothing
What can you say? Nothing
What would he say? He'd ask you if you want him to give up everything for you
Then all his time will be yours
Bullshit
So, I called the bakery today, and the boss was in the City
I ordered a Big Mac, fries and a coke, and asked Movie Guy to let the boss know that I still wanted the job
Evidently there are more people to come in for a day's work, Movie Guy mentioned two people in the following days
There are a few other possiblities mentioned in the Almighty job bank - a line cook at a pub, and an assistant manager of a newly-opened video rental place
I am busily trying to convince myself that I would be qualified for the rental place
I suppose I am, but I'm experiencing issues as to how to explain to someone else that I'd be good at it
Don't really feel like I'm all that stellar at anything at the moment; I just feel sick and tired, and worried
Stellar worrier, perhaps
Kurt had his first day of classes today; unlike last year, he actually slept the night before
Last year, he was like a kid on Christmas Eve
I can really tell he's happy - he's being a jerk, and has been picking on me all day
He's been thinking about overloading, and attempting an early graduation
On the outset, seems like a good idea, save for he's unsure about what to do next, and shorting himself out on a couple of years can't come in handy when making decisions
At the same time, though, the sooner he graduates, the less student loans
It's not a decision anyone should have to make; wondering if you should speed up your education to save money
Education is supposed to be a right, right? Fucking reality, it always gets in the way of things
I Went fishing by myself on my normal Tuesday off
I'm still using the 1/2oz bullet weight with my homemade rope lure
This time I thought I would stop in at the Pic Nic Basket Bait and Tackle Shop to pick up some red dye with garlic scent
I used it in the spring with good success but I've been out for some time now
I'm not sure if the dye did it but I caught my biggest Longnose Gar of the month using it
It had to weight almost 15-20 lbs
Talking about a chunk now! It was about 50 inches long&nbsp;and fat fat fat! I wished I had someone with me&nbsp;to&nbsp;take a picture of me with this&nbsp;awesome specimen of a&nbsp;fish
I tried to hold&nbsp;it while I set the timer on my digital camera but as I held it off the side of the boat in case it got rowdy that's just what It did and&nbsp;Fatty slipped from my hand and into the water
I guess that's better than getting bite trying to do something that difficult
I should probably introduce myself
My name is Benjamin Ingram; I'm fifteen, and from a little town in the middle of fucking nowhere; Dupo, Illinois
You probably know a kid like me
The ones that sit in the back of the class, dress in black, and are outcasts in general
They listen to music that scares you, and you're afraid that they'll bring a gun to school and shoot a hole in your head
Don't worry; most of us are generally harmless, and just looking to be loved/understood by our peers
My birthday is Jan
22, 1989
I'm 5'10, and my weight fluctuates between 160-180 pounds
I've got short hair, it's usually spiked, and sideburns; although I plan on growing it out in the near future
My favorite band is Marilyn Manson
Yeah; I know Goths consider him a poseur and metalheads consider him a pussy, but he's neither
Yes, he's a shrewed businessman; but he has a depth to his lyrics unmatched
Other favorite bands of mine are Rob Zombie, In Flames, Killswitch Engage, Deicide, Nine Inch Nails, Children of Bodom, Arch Enemy, Bittersweet Symphony, Alice Cooper {before he turned Christian, that is}, Kataklysm, Bauhaus, Depeche Mode, and Type O Negative
I HATE Korn and Slipknot
Rap and pop sucks ass; and modern punk is little better {although I do have an appreciation for older punk rock}
I love dark art, poetry and horror and science fiction movies
I hate people that are all one way or the other
I can't stand people that are either constantly pissed off or constantly happy
Life doesn't suck so much that you have to hate everything and appreciate nothing; and life has nothing in it worth being happy all the time
Life might not be all pain and sorrow, but it isn't all rainbows and puppies, either
Nor can I stand shallow people
I normally don't listen to rap; but I was riding in the car with my aunt, and she turned on her 'hip-hop' bullshit, and I heard a song about shoes
'Air Force Ones' or some such shit
How much more shallow can you get? Does a particular brand of shoes invoke so much emotion in somebody that it's worthy of writing a song {and I use the phrase loosely} about? If it does, that's completely shallow
Two other things I can't stand are people that try to enforce their will on other people, and those that judge a book by it's cover, so to speak
I'm an athiestic Satanist; I'm not a strict follower of LaVey, but I agree with his principles
This doesn't mean I worship the devil
I don't; as I believe in him about as much as the Christian God {meaning, I don't}
I simply believe he represents the admirable qualities in humanity; namely, will power, self reliance, rational egotism, etc
He makes a good role model
Which leads me to my second point: People judge me by my cover
I come off as emotionless and uncaring to most people, but I'm not
I've been used and abused so much that I act like this because I don't want to be hurt anymore
To the people that let me open up, however, I think I show that I have feelings
Strong ones at that, as I'm a very emotional person
As for girls, yeah, I like them
But I hate how some guys use them for sex; and I hate even more how girls are willing to be used
Sex is good, sex if fun; but it shouldn't be the focalpoint of a relationship
It's just another drug used by people everyday; along with religion, television, etcetera ad infinatum
I can't stand girls that just want a 'good time' and 'fun' and don't want to actually FEEL emotion
I've met some of them and even fallen for one once; and I was hurt deeply by it
Never again
My current girlfriend is Jamie Kern
I just got out of a seven month rocky relationship with a bi-polar girl whom I won't name out of courtesy
It really hurt me; so I think I'll take it slow this time and not fuck things up {as per my norm}
I'll post more later; but seeing as how it's 7:00 in the morning and I've been awake since four yesterday afternoon, I'll have to get back to you on that one
I'm going over to Jamie's today; should be fun
Oh yes, if you'd like to contact me for any reason, my e-mail address is psychotic_metalhead@hotmail
I look forward to talking to you
Ta,  Ben     A pill to make you numb, a pill to make you dumb, a pill to make you anybody else- But all the drugs in this world won't save her from herself

Well, this evening was a strange adventure
Through the poison-laced web of my mother's mind came a whisper of an idea that she should have dinner with me this week
She called on Tuesday saying my father wanted to see me and have dinner but that he wasn't there at the moment
I told her to tell him to call me when he was back so we could make an arrangement
She said fine
I got a call on Wednesday night from her saying they wanted to see me Friday
I said perhaps, but that Thursday was better
I mentioned that we should do an early dinner, and she said that was great
Today, I called before I left work (5:30) to see what the status of things was
Apparently my father was on business and wouldn't be able to leave before 6, which was fine
An early dinner by 6:30 or 7 doesn't hurt at all
Thus, I left work and went home expecting to hear from my parents at some point, informing me of their departure from home headed in my general direction
At 9:00pm I still hadn't heard anything from my parents (I napped from 6:30
to prepare for the parental onslaught)
I called them to see what was the matter
They said they were just leaving and they'd call me when they were near
Fine, I say
Starving
At around 9:30 my mother phones from her mobile telling me that they are almost there, and I ask where we're going to dinner and if I should dress better-than-casual
She nonchalantly mentions that they've had dinner already and that we were just going out for dessert and coffee
Excuse me??     I waited for 4 hours, (not to mention that I'd had a particularly light lunch today) for coffee and dessert?!  I sputtered audibly on the phone, and just said 'OK' and hung up
My mother, font of charity that she is, showed up at my apartment door with a garbage bag - a garbage bag, in all its sagging, plastic glory - of 'food' for my dinner
Now, I'm not sure if it was the presentation (she was holding it out to me in that 'ick' manner, as if the contents were precisely what any onlooker would expect a container of that sort to house) or the fact that upon opening the bag, I was greeted with two apples and four granola bars, that caused the vein in my left lobe to rupture
But rupture it did, and with it my poise - my expression soured and I walked past her into the street voicelessly
She asked if anything was the matter but I was determined not to make a point out of it
However, she was
She prodded and picked and pulled just like the mechanical harvester which made those lovely granola bars possible - and I, like the grain, yielded, then gave
Yet after thirty minutes of calm conversation, she couldn't seem to grasp that there would be any reason to be annoyed
So I became irate, just to help color the picture better
I explained (again) that I'd been waiting four hours for them, and they didn't so much as give me the courtesy of a one minute phone call to tell me that they were going to, were in the process of, or had already, eaten dinner, yet waited until they were ten minutes away to tell me that I was to be having no dinner and only coffee and dessert
Outrageous
I'm one to talk though
I dropped it as soon as I realized there was no point in chasing it
My parents will never be on time
My parents will never 'understand' me
My parents will never grant me common courtesies, because that would be 'bending,' and one doesn't bend for their children
Other points to come soon
Moving on- we went to an old haunt of my father's from his NYU days, but he was disappointed to see that it was under new ownership and wasn't as he remembered it
What ensued was a very interesting tour of the general West Village area around MacDougal Street and the surrounding blocks, led by my dad and highlighting where the popular hangouts were, who worked where, what store was operated by what people and what the area looked like
It was very very engrossing and I quickly forgot that it was in fact almost midnight
Overall, good times, thanks to dad
I'm not a perfect person As many things I wish I didn't do But I continue learning I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new And the reason is you  I'm sorry that I hurt you It's something I must live with everyday And all the pain I put you through I wish that I could take it all away And be the one who catches all your tears That's why I need you to hear  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new And the reason is you
And the reason is you
And the reason is you
And the reason is you
I'm not a perfect person I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new And the reason is you  I've found a reason to show A side of me you didn't know A reason for all that I do And the reason is you   sayangilah orang yang menyayangi diri kamu, kerana orang yang kamu sayangi itu,  belum tentu dapat meyayangi diri kamu!  menerima orang yang mencintai diri kita,  lebih baik daripada memilih orang yang kita cintai

:) I came across this while looking for music for my page
Well, after reading blog after blog, day after day, I've decided to start one of my own
I don't expect anyone to read it, but that's not the point anyways
Or is it?  Who knows
As of now, I'm just doing this to pass the time at work!  MuuWhahahahahaha!  Edit: Apparently there is a timestamp issue
Although this is the first post, it was apparently submitted through a time-space continuum into the future
urlLink Rick James is dead
I can't believe that Blogger has been breaking on me every time I've tried to update all week, and the time it works is when I screw around and click the B on the 'Rick James is dead' story
If this actually posts maybe I can upload some of this week's update retro-style
If not, I swear things will get back to normal as soon as Blogger quits freaking out
Well this might be the first common sense decision Ive seen made by a foreign government in a long time
The Greeks have decided to allow US special forces and security personnel to be armed while working the Olympic games scheduled for next month
This is in contradiction with Olympic tradition, and in fact, with Greek law
It really is nice to know that some governments in the world don't have their head up their ass all the time
The Greeks have obviously taken note that the world in which we live has changed dramatically, and have made a tough and brave decision
The Olympic security costs have already surpassed 2 billion dollars, just to get set up and ready
Wouldn't it be just downright silly if God forbid something did happen and none of the good guys had guns to react with?  Bravo to the Greeks for their obvious Common Sense!   Arrick

Too much information  Today, standing on the  train  ( not  the good-smelling one) lodged between  a pole  and  two female persons  of the   Cole Valley  variety  I learned the following:    Patty  is  only  43 and has already started  menopause    Jill  and  Frank  are celebrating their  5th anniversary  but with the   baby   it's probably going to be a  stay-at home  thing   Karen  thinks that's a shame and will  take the baby  but probably can't take  Melissa  since she's already  got the girls  and they're having a  slumber party , but on second thought, maybe  Melissa  can come if  Jill  thinks she won't be bored   Jill  thinks she won't be bored but  Karen   knows   Frank  and he's not going to want to do anything anyway   Karen  thinks maybe a  BB-Q  after the  kid's game  might be fun   Jill  is astonished to learn that the  kid's game  will  only last 30 minutes    Karen  assures her that it's because it's  T-ball  then suggests that perhaps they should just  take off  [I'm assuming the two of them] and 'celebrate' on their own [not super sure how it ended up being 'thier'  anniversary  but maybe i'm missing some 'used-to-be-together'  lesbo  vibe
]     Jill  thinks this is a grand idea and wants to go to  Sonoma  [ Sonoma??! ]   Karen  thinks maybe  Marin  or  Sausalito  but remembers she can't because the  sonogram is on Tuesday  [sooo, not sure how this information is pertinent but again, p'raps I'm missing something]   Karen's  mom and her grandmother all started menopause  at the age of 43    and , we're back to  Patty
Do I need to meet these people at a dinner party? I think not
I feel like we went to high school together fer chrissakes
That  Frank  guy, though, needs to catch a  fast clue  cause hand-to-god if he  doesn't  step up quick, before he can put 6 and 9 together, his little lady's gonna take  Missy  and the  Bub  and set up some housekeeping with 'her good friend, and sometimes f***buddy',  Karen
now then, where were we
? Ah, yes, being  sunny and light  about the world
Last night the  Boo  opened a present she'd just received from her  Great Gramma  and ta-da! A copy of   Doctor Doolittle   that was given to my Gramma in  1924  by her teacher! Yay!  Gramma  also enclosed some of the notes we've (me and my brothers) written her during our time on the planet together
Consider an exerpt written by a thirteen year old  Chick  about a pillow:   Hello G-ma, How are you? I am fine
Things here are going well
Did you get the pillow I made you? I made one for my mom too that says 'Kiss the cook'   [Kiss the cook?? on a pillow? I ask you
!]    she says she likes it   [bless her sweet heart! I wonder if she still has it? I should ask - hee hee]   and that it was just the thing she needed
[??!]   Anyway, I'm going to go now
I love you and hope you and G-pa are doing o
out in all that snow!   [Har Har! Get it?? They live in North Dakota! Snow!! eh, hem
]   Bye for now
Kiss the cat for me!   [I have no idea
-ed]'   Yay! we heart  Gramma/Great Gramma !!      Big shout out to my  Best buddy Q  who is sick and dying
Sorry Sweetie, hope you feel better soon
Let me know if I can do anything to help

Have you ever wondered why people are like that? Okay, so maybe I psychoanalyse *no, no, i'm not clever
i'm sure it's spelt wrong* people too much (or maybe it's because I'm listening to Goo Goo Dolls) Hmm
Why do people ignore you? Why do you ignore them? Maybe you're ignoring the fact that you don't or do like them or some thing
(I'm sure there's too many inuendo's to list in that!) Why do some people go out of their way to make your world worse, why do they go out of their way to make it better? But then, if you analyse things too much then you don't live, you watch
It's hard
I was shamed into washing the car last night after several people made comments regarding how dirty it was
It got so dirty by driving through a construction zone on Telegraph road that had standing water on it
&nbsp;        Last night I pulled out the hose and gave it a really good wash, along with polishing the visible parts of the  urlLink Magnaflow Exhaust  system
I got into all the crevices of the wheels and got ride of two weeks worth of brake dust as well
The chin spoiler still needs some deal of scrubbing to get some grime off of it, but I'll have to tackle that another day
&nbsp;        This car looks sweet when it's cleaned
I'll have to post some pictures of it later on in the week

`Je, natuwa ka ata sa blog
^^,  Ala ako masabi eh
Un lang muna
EDIT:  Este, meron pala
Just made my own blog
Janget pa ung template eh, pero i'll change dat into my very own template when i got time

com tapos invite ko na lang kyo pag me oras, oke? Ok
I seem to be losing pleasure again
Nothing elicits excitment
Just the mundane running of a smooth household
Today rambles into yesterday, into tomorrow
This I will hide like I always do and I will smile a toothfilled grin kiss my children, make love to my husband and all will be well with them
For me this is my life, where I love being but yern for some excitment, some impromptu reaction
The washing machine drones on, the stove burns, I remain still waiting to be heard or seen, recognizition is so over rated I guess
Daily I scramble to the top, like an unseen race
Maybe here I am creating my own thrill
Pushing to see if I can make it, see if I can win
But tomorrow arrives and the diapers pile up the laundry is never completely done
The beds are a mess again, the booboos need to be kissed, and I run again to some unseen trophy
The crown I wear is stretchmarks, and fat
Oh gosh what am I, I am suppose to be mother and wife, but I am tired so very tired, here the smile will grow and I raise my head above the ashes I create in my mind, and I forge ahead
Some days I look at yesterday, at youth and wonder what if, but there is no glory there, no lonliness, no work, just the rosy glow of yesterdays dreams
Then I snap back to reality and remember this IS my dream, what I work for, this is my glow, and I smile
Is it just me or do timings come awkwardly? The first weekend of the holidays and i planned to go out on the saturday, but what happened? I had to stay at home and wait for the french student to arrive at my house and to welcome him
I waited a whole day not knowing when exactly he would arrive at my house and so i wasted a whole day when i could have gone out and watched a movie
That's ok though, i guess
what really annoys me is this weekend was the one weekend where my parents wanted to go to the snow, and that could possibly mean taking my sister and my parents, which in turn could mean i would be home alone free to do whatever, free to have whoever come over, but noo
- I am in my current state of mind annoyed, but i must say i was errr well i wasn't so sure i wanted to meet the French student because well Iv never had a french student stay at my house before -
Anyway the French student seems, 'sympa' as he said to me or, 'nice' and well he does seem quite nice, but it appears his friend doesn't like chinese people
This i gathered after his friend asked of me to stand in front of the webcam his initial reaction i would have no idea what he said, it was way too slang, but he eventually got around to saying j'aime pas chintook
This i would take as being i dont like chinese but then again i don't like those ppl who stereotype 0
0 damn stereotypers -
Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
So make the best of this test, and don't ask why
It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time
It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right
I hope you had the time of your life

Newspaper report said that youngsters nowadays are very 'into' internet chatrooms and getting abused becoz of this
I thought this was so long ago
But the new thingy that is taking we teenagers over the storm is 'Friendster' (I have linked it at the bottom of my blog
Scroll down and enter to 'Friendster')
That's true
Coz I am a little crazy over this new programme
But I am a little introvert, so not many friends or testimoniels
But ok
The downside of 'Friendster' is that it runs very slow at times and runs like a bullet at very rare times
But I heard that the management will look into it
And I have not made new friends so far, just found many ex- primary school friends
Well, I have to just keep looking
So my plans today have changed
I had one of my appointments cancel on me, which I don't mind as I didn't want to drive all the way to the city today for a half hour appt
But now I am so unmotivated to do anything
This is so my problem
I could sit and watch TV all day, but what a waste of a day
Especially when I have so much crap I need to do before I leave on Sunday for training
So I am going climbing today with Satan, unless he calls and says he doesn't feel like it and is coming home early
It would just be my luck
As I need to get some climbing in, as I won't be able to climb while I  am at training
Well I did put a load of laundry in, so at least my clothes will be clean before I leave
I did walk the dogs today too
And Satan told me I coddle my youngest dog too much, and now she is a wuss
Can't help it, she is just so damn cute and needs hugs, and she likes hugs
But she follows me around all the time now, which I don't mind, but I think Satan may feel like the dog is not paying enough attention to him
As she used to follow him everywhere when she was a puppy
But I am sure the roles will reverse when I leave on Sunday, and when I am back in a week and 1/2, she will give me the cold shoulder
So I am obsessing over the dogs while I will be away
Not Satan, I know he can take care of himself, its just my darling girls I will miss
I keep telling Satan he needs to talk to them and do stupid things with them like I do while I am gone so they won't feel abandoned
He said anarchy will happen while I am gone, and they will all be living the life
Most amusing
So anyway, back to my original rambling I get side tracked a lot, its pre alsheimers, I just know it
Anyway I am canceling the other meeting I had today which is the one for the school
Again, don't want to drive all that way for that, and I can reschedule, so when I call to cancel I will rebook for when I am back, as not to pass this opportunity by
As when I spoke to Satan about it last night he thought it was a good idea to check into it as well
Ok, must get motivated to do something
This is a part of a series of posts that deal with the upcoming celebration of Easter
Today, Thursday, is the day that traditionally Christians celebrate to be the last supper that Christ had with his followers
It is during this dinner that Christ drops the final hint that he is soon to be crucified
But I believe that the significance of today lies in an event that occurred after that supper
Namely it was the time that Christ wrestled in prayer with his Father regarding going to the cross
This is the crux of Christ's prayer in the garden of Gethsemane
It was a struggle of wills
Jesus as God had full knowledge of the horrors of the cross, the physical horrors and the spiritual horrors
We focus alot only on the fact that Christ suffered  physically on the cross, forgetting that Christ suffered a seperation from his eternal Father because he carried the sin of the world
Furthermore, the WRATH of God fell upon Christ on that cross
The WRATH that God had on every sin that was committed and every sin to come
This was dreadful
But back to the garden
The struggle in the garden was crucial because in it we see the agony of Christ about what is going to happen and finally we see the amazing obedience that Christ performed in submitting to the will of his Father
I wonder how painful that was? But it was done because Christ loved his Father and furthermore loved us literally to death
Please take time to today and ponder the struggle that Christ went through
Reflect on the cost that he was precieving
Furthemore reflect on what obedience to God means in your life
You may find this article by  urlLink Greg Laurie  helpful as you ponder your own obedience (click  urlLink here  for the article)
In the mean time,  urlLink read  and meditate on what acually happened in the garden:   'And He came out and proceeded as was His custom to the Mount of Olives; and the disciples also followed Him
When He arrived at the place, He said to them, 'Pray that you may not enter into temptation
' And He withdrew from them about a stone's throw, and He knelt down and began to pray, saying, 'Father, if You are willing, remove this cup from Me; yet not My will, but Yours be done
' Now an angel from heaven appeared to Him, strengthening Him
And being in agony He was praying very fervently; and His sweat became like drops of blood, falling down upon the ground
Enjoy What You Do    I received this email from a friend, who drives a truck across the country for a living
Another week down, and I hope all dads had a wonderful day Sunday
I am in Las Vegas for a few days of rest & relaxation with my brother, sister-in-law, and friends from church! For instance, I saw The Strip, Hoover Dam, and with some singles here, ate sushi! Gamble? Nope
I may make good money, but gambling will lose it
My trips for the week
Roanoke VA to Des Moines IA and Roseville MN (mail), Roseville MN to Denver CO (plastic drop covers), Fort Collins CO to Las Vegas NV (Budweiser beer)
Anyway, I pray you all find joy in something you do
Why do something just for money, when you can find a job that both pays AND makes you happy?  I understand some may have a job simply to make money, and if so, enjoy it!

I've spent the past two Tuesday nights and Wednesday mornings speaking at Forest Home's Family Camps
Great people and great time to dive into thoughts on passing along spiritual legacy to the next generation
&nbsp; The highlight, though was getting to hang out with Angie and the high school staff at high school camp
I absolutely love what they're doing this summer there
For those of you who think that there are no camps that are exploring new ways of embracing life in Jesus -&nbsp;FH is bringing it!&nbsp;I think Angie is one of more amazing people I know
She's got a great vision for helping students dialogue over the faith, wrestling with what they believe, and not pushing some stale, regurgitated 'decision' to 'make Jesus your personal Savior and Lord
' The camp experience is designed to help students process and talk about their questions, doubts and feelings about God
Flat out one of the best camp experiences I've seen - well worth a look!
I got an e-mail called 'RE: I will cheat on mmy husband with you'! Does the words 'bugger off' mean any thing to these people? I also got an e-mail from Neopets, apparantly I lost my password and was trying to find it out - in English some one tried to hack me
What a dumb ass, that's a dumb way to hack, hell that's not even hacking! Learn how to hack guys! Yeay I'm playing games! (Well that's a change
) Heeey! It's fun! Hehe, I'll talk about today later, this is kind of pointless and it might ruin that!
Baka:  I know, let's get rid of Buddha and Kuronue and Kenshin and Inu-Yasha

and now i keep getting random sms activation codes
this is so pointless
where is the love?
It seems it has been forever
The last time I wrote an entry, well�
needless to say is was a couple weeks ago
I am going to try and catch up
As I have mentioned before, I am a list person, so I best think and write my thoughts as such�a list that is
It is now the beginning of my fourth week at  urlLink United Rentals
I work 7am to about 6pm, long days
The days move pretty quickly, so it isn�t bad at all
I make $10 an hour, so overtime will be really nice! I got my first paycheck this last Friday, and damn does it feel good
Too bad it is practically already spent�catching up on things I haven�t paid since I have been out of work at the beginning of April
Ah well
The situation with Rob�I have seen him for about 5 weekends in a row now
We have been pretty much exclusive
We had a chat the other day, as I had questioned why we weren�t together if we weren�t seeing anyone else
End of a long story�he will be taking some time to think, get his thoughts together
He doesn�t want to commit to a relationship and feels that he would be passing up the opportunity to meet someone else
So I am leaving it at that
He knows I will always be here to talk to, and he calls daily which is wonderful, but I have put a hold to what I was going for originally with him
Going to wait to see how things pan out I suppose
I want to publicly thank the wonderful Jason Brown for the awesome CD�s that he burned and brought me on Sunday
I think this may be the first time I have introduced the lad, but I think and hope to be writing a bit more about him
He is a friend from Northridge, works as a computer programmer for a banking institution down that ways, and he and I seem to have tons in common
He unfortunately is in a relationship, well a type of relationship at the moment
Yet more patience on my part�going to hang around as a friend, one of my best capacities ever I admit, but I think it may be time for something more for Traci
Stay tuned to see how things with Jason turn
I now want to publicly apologize to Steve and Melissa
Things are rough for me and Steve
There was a point that I wanted to explore more than our friendship, but after a serious talk, I realized (not only was he not interested in exploring) that we were much better off as friends
I considered us good friends at that
While things were rough with Rob and I, things seemed to be going excellent for Steve and his beautiful girlfriend Melissa
End of a long story�I partook of some alcohol (which Steve quickly pointed out was of my own volition and can not be claimed as a defense, even in the State of California system of law) and because of it didn�t take the time to think of what I was saying before I said things
My complete bad�I admit this
I made a statement at a party, the first time I met Melissa in fact, that offended her
To Melissa, I hope you read this, I had some meaning behind what I said, and I am sorry I did not know better and phrase what I was trying to say in a better way
I hope to have the opportunity to regain the respect from both you and Steve that I lost in my first impression
I have never seen Steve be as happy, as excited, and as school-boyish as he is when he talks about you
I saw this and it made me so happy that he was happy, something he has been waiting for�perfection
Because of the times I was going through, I didn�t give the two of you the congrats you deserved
I apologize
That night at the party, the two of you did nothing but make sense
Unfortunately all I did has hurt both of you, and as a result I have lost the respect I had from Steve, a good friend I talked with, and with his Steve-ness seemed to make things a little better
I have talked with him, and I hope this strengthens all I told him
I hope to be able to gain back some of the respect that I have lost�from both of you
I invite everyone to the premiere of �Jesus Christ Superstar�
Funny thing, it opens on my birthday July 18th
It will be an awesome show�Jerusalem Meets the Matrix

Written by Anglicka Fields     In my darkness, faded black, behinde the light I hide
Too bright for me to feel the warmth of liers and evil doers
I hide in my saftey spot, hoping for some relief
I find comfort in my shelter of no color at all
This is my place for unity and soul searching
This is my world of happy thoughts, acid trips and meditation
I strive for a place called even and true
And then I fade away again
and again
and again
In my darkness, faded grey, behinde the dim light I sit
Just enough darkness mixed with light for me to feel the hate of enimies and tattle-tellers
I sit in my saftey spot, enjoying the relief
I found comfort in my shelter of grey
This is my place for friendship and soul sharing
This place joined my world of happy thoughts and shots of EverClear and meditation
And still I strive for a place called even and true
And then I fade away again
and again
and again
In my darkness, faded white, behinde the pure wanderous light, I hide
Perfect light for me to see the truth of us, you and me and everyone else
I float on my saftey, enduring the reilef
I found comfort in my shelter of white
This is my place for purity and soul bearing, This place joined my darkeness and grey
I have found place called Even and True
And then I fade away again
and again
and again
i don't want to write anything for you because it would be a betrayal of all hope and i don't even know what's going on so how can i say that everything's gone wrong? but i know it has
you were there when no one else was and when i couldn't believe anything you smiled and said, 'it will be okay' and i believed that because i have always believed in you
no matter what you do
no one is saying anything but that says everything to me i didn't sleep last night because i was afraid to dream afraid the dreams would turn out true-- and i'd lose you
but i refuse to believe anything that no one's saying and today is the first day i'll spend the whole day praying hoping that someone up there's listening when i scream that you mean so much to me
and that means everything

Here it is
chapter 1
Remember to comment with feedback when you're done
Thank you
&&&    Chapter 1   My body jumped as the familiar buzzing in my purse made me grab my cell phone subconsciously
I held the phone in front of my face and my fingers began to push random buttons
I had a text message
I opened the text messaging folder and gasped at what the snippet line read
I couldn’t be
I opened the message and finished reading the short sentence present on the screen
I want to see you again
How could I let this happen?  How could I have even considered what I was doing?  It wasn’t like I was single either
I was a happily married woman
I loved my husband more than anyone could ever know
To any normal person, what I was doing was officially wrong, a sin even
Under the eyes of God I was in a binded relationship that couldn’t be broken without serious paperwork involved
Yet I had another man text massaging me, calling my cell phone when he found free time, even emailing me
I know it sounds strange to anyone that doesn’t know the whole story
If I’m  so  in love with my husband then where did I find the time to meet someone else?  And why did I even attempt to?  But it’s not like that, I swear
I met him at a Hanson concert a few months ago
And since then, my life has totally changed
------    “Honey, my mother bought me tickets to see Hanson,” I said excitedly
“The tickets should be here in a few weeks
” “Good for you,” he said with the roll of his eyes
Kyle knew how much I loved Hanson
I made it very clear to him that he was not to try to change my love for the guys
And I wouldn’t change his love for sports
“At least now this balances out with you going to New York in October,” I said
“Now I have something special to look forward to
” I had been a fan of Hanson since the “MMMBop days
”  My favorite Hanson was like every other girl on the planet; Taylor
But when young Zac went through puberty, grew taller, and grew more manly, my feelings changed
For awhile, before my desire for Zac, I thought Isaac was pretty hot; but he just never stuck to me the way the other two did
Alas, it had been my dream to meet the guys and tell them how much their lives as celebrities had helped me surpass so many obstacles over the years
Two months before I went to my first concert in June of 1998, my grandfather passed away to cancer
At the concert they sang “With You in Your Dreams” in which I had a difficult time getting through
I felt the boys love for their fans that night
It made me respect them even more than I already did
That night made me believe they truly meant it when they said they cherished their fans
The one thing I always wanted to do was to meet them; to try to convey my gratitude to them being one of the biggest supports in my life
I sometimes wonder if that is why I’m still a fan today; if I’m trying to hold onto the past
But I don’t believe it because I know my love for them is as real as their love for me is
“When is the concert?” Kyle asks, glancing away from the baseball game that blares from our TV
“It’s the day before your birthday
The twentieth,” I said
He says nothing and turns back to his game
I roll my eyes and wonder how I can love this man so much
I met Kyle three years ago in January of 2001
His younger sister had offered to hook us up and I agreed; just to see what he was like
Two days later we became an official couple
He is Italian, and you can definitely tell it when you visit his grandparents’ house
I knew the night I met him that he would become my husband someday
It was something my mother had always told me, “You’ll just know,” she would say
I never understood until Kyle stepped into my life
He was different, and he was definitely not a child
He had morals, values, and wanted to be taken seriously; yet he wanted to have fun while doing it
And he isn’t bad looking either
Standing 6’2” with brown hair buzzed neatly to his head and eyes blue of that of an ocean in New England, he’s something to look at
I’m surprised when he choose me as his companion
Compared to my short 4’11” frame, people must think we make an odd couple
But we love each other, and I guess that’s all that matters
Ever since our relationship started, I knew it wasn’t going to be like my past relationships
Kyle moved in with my mother and me only three months into our relationship
Three years later, this past March, I decided I didn’t want to live with my mother anymore
Kyle had been itching to move, but I knew I couldn’t afford it
But something inside me snapped, and I wanted to make it work
I wanted to know what it was like to be on my own
For Christ sakes, I turned twenty-three a month prior
Kyle and I applied to an apartment complex down the street from my mother’s condo
We got approved for the apartment three days later
Because of the move, my health insurance would be canceled since I wouldn’t be living at home anymore
At the end of March Kyle and I mutually decided to get married so I could fall on his insurance
We had two dates in mind
May 8th or May 15th
I was leaning more towards May 8th because it would’ve been two years and one month after Taylor Hanson and his wife Natalie’s wedding date
But that date wasn’t happening; it was Mother’s Day weekend
After a week of debating, May 15, 2004 was the date etched in stone that was to be when I would become a wife
Though there wasn’t a proper proposal, I didn’t really care
All that mattered was Kyle and me
On the weekend of April 2nd, I traveled to Maine with my father to visit my family there and to start picking out wedding gowns
When I returned home my father handed us $60 to go out to dinner and left us bewildered
So we went to dinner at a nice little Italian place up the street, came home and changed into our scrubs, and began watching baseball
During a commercial, Kyle stood from his lazy sitting position on the arm chair and started a little speech
“As you know, we’re getting married,” he started off
“And as you know, there is something that hasn’t been done yet
I have something I want to give to you that belongs to your family
They wanted you to have it
” He continued with saying that it was an heirloom passed down to my father’s older sister
After he finished talking, he grabbed my hand and stood me in front of him
Taking a deep breath, he said “I already know the answer, but it’s nice to hear it anyway
”  I could tell he was shaking as he got down on one knee and looked into my eyes as he asked, “Will you marry me?” in a childish tone, the “Kyle tone” as the game came back on in the background
Now I was shocked
I had wanted for two years to have those words uttered from his lips
I never thought this moment would happen
And it couldn’t have been more perfect
It was how I dreamed of it with Kyle; some sort of sport happening in the background
It was just the way it was meant to be, and it was nothing sort of what I expected
“Yes,” I said as he prepared the ring for me
I removed the rings I had already on my finger; an opal he gave to me our first Christmas together, and a tiny heart shaped ring with an amethyst (my birthstone) in the center
I set them aside as he took the tiny diamond from its case and took my left hand in his hand
The ring fit perfectly
That night I called everyone in my family
It was then that our unity was official
It was really going to happen
-------    I re-read the message on my screen
I wanted to see him too
I didn’t even know he was in town
But something was holding me back to reply to him
I couldn’t do it to my husband
But I wanted to
It had been a few months since I last saw him, at that concert in July
It was now October, and the air around me grew chilly as I thought of what to write back
Finally I settled on  I want to see you too
I closed my eyes and bit my lip as my finger hit ‘send
’  What are you doing?   I silently scolded myself
Then a thought hit me suddenly
Did I really love my husband or had he always been a sort of backup plan?
although i've been to kingston upon thames, rather than kingston jamaica
does that matter?
The  urlLink  Tour de France   is in its third and final week
The riders have gone through the initial flat stages, the killer Pyrenees Mountains, and now have entered the mighty Alps
Thomas Voeckler is currently leading the race, but is expected to lose the yellow jersey today
He is not a 'mountain man,' having lost all but 22 seconds of his almost 10-minute lead over Lance Armstrong in two big mountain days
Barring a meltdown (which is always possible), Lance should be in yellow today, and his team will fight to keep him in the  maillot jaune  ('yellow jersey') all the way to the finish line in Paris
If he wins, it truly will be because of his team
Let me tell you a little about how team cycling works
Each team is built around a leader - the person most likely to win the event
The other 8 members of the team fill the role of  domestique , which is French for 'servant
' Regardless of how good you are, if you are a domestique, your job is to get your leader onto the winner's podium
Some domestiques have very specific roles
Some are great on the flat stretches, others are sprinters and still others are great at steep ascents
They serve the leader accordingly
In Lance's stage victory this past Saturday, certain pairs of guys were tasked with bringing Lance up (and down) each of the mountains
Here are some things the  urlLink  US Postal   domestiques do for their captain Lance:   - They ride in front of him to break the wind resistance
This cuts down Lance's exertion by 40%
- They get food and drinks from the team car, and then sprint back to the team to distribute it to everyone
- They surround him when the pack is very thick, to protect him from accidents
- When there is a breakaway, they chase the rider(s) down and rein them in
- If Lance has a flat tire, one of them give him theirs
If he crashes, they give him one of their bikes
- Everyone rotates in the front, pulling the rest of the team
Lance never has to
These guys could care less where in the standings they eventually finish
They lead Lance as far as they can go, and when they're spent, they fall quickly to the back (sometimes the VERY back) in exhaustion as Lance powers to the finish
What kind of job is this? There's absolutely no glory for these guys
unless they're watching their leader up on the podium when it's all over
So it is with the Body of Christ
We are organized around our Leader, and each of us has our supporting role as domestiques
For some of us, the supporting role is a little more high-profile
José Azevedo, leading Lance up the final mountain on Saturday, got a lot of camera time and praise from the announcers
Look at that, I even remember his name
On the flip side, most of the domestiques get almost zero camera time
They never show the guy with his jersey stuffed in the front and back with about 20 full water bottles, huffing and puffing back up to his team
To bring the analogy home, we have our 'star Christians
' They include pastors, writers and entertainers
Their work for the Leader gets lots of attention, and with it praise (and criticism)
Our garden-variety domestiques, however, are everywhere
They are the Sunday school teachers, people who set up before church or run the sound system
They stuff bulletins, give a needy person a ride or lunch
Ideally, these people are not concerned with where 'in the standings' they finish
They serve the Leader, confident of His sure victory
&nbsp;  Lance's teammates naturally share in the spoils - it's not like they are minimum-wage burger flippers for their captain Ronald McDonald
So will we share in the glory and victory of our Leader when he assumes His place on the podium when this 'Tour de Earth' is over
Okay, I'm analogy'd out
Have a great day!

hazy illusions cloud my mind: foggy, as if there could be a mist somewhere, a change in temparature

but smiling

What inspires us to write? Is it pain, joy, worry, freedom, love? It must be all these things of life that cause a rush of thought and a spattering of words
But, these emotions are never isolated
They always have some connection to God, humanity, to ourselves
It's the connection of life that inspires us to great thought and lovely declaration
It's relationship and all the messiness and beauty that flows from kissing lips, holding hands, cradling heads, bowing knees, praising hearts
&nbsp;  Two amazing, strong women in my life have inspired me to write -- if only to tell their stories
Their stories are my stories- my mother, my sister, my reflections
&nbsp;   The Spirit Vine --   for my loving mother, Naomi   &nbsp;   A chronicle that needs no telling,  Enduring balance in an unwavering line
&nbsp;  Of mind and heart and gaze compelling,  Tender branches from the same spirit vine
&nbsp;  A steadfast journey of wisdom, strength, of grace bestowing,  A descent of favor and spark of eternal insight
&nbsp;  Vivid, shining, restoring, knowing –  An ancient beacon, a living signal light
&nbsp;  &nbsp;   Veils --   for my enduring sister, Savannah   &nbsp;   Lay your veiled regret upon me,  Bare the ache of things gone wrong,  Visit the dreams that are never to be,  Cry the wounding tears of the silent song
&nbsp;  Laugh into the mist of love’s pleasure,  Bask in the flowered rings of youth,  Vision the jewels of life’s treasure,  Capture the whisper of our hidden truth
A Strange Thing just happened to me
I attempted to sign into my account to post here, only to discover that I had been signed out
Even stranger is that I did not sign myself out, and I did not write down my password, etc in my password reference place when I started this account, so I had to do a re-registration thingy and change my password
Very odd
It's  good thing I'd previously planned on going out today, as the weather is grey and miserable all over the area
As an added bonus, Roommate/Landlord has finished teaching for the summer, so he's in the basement sleeping and I cannot insulate anything today
In all likelihood this means that at just about the time my Fiberglas burns from yesterday have healed, I will have to start again
I'm angry about this lack of household improvement only because I was in a groove yesterday before I had to stop and clean up, and I'll probably forget what the heck I'm doing before I start again
Been searching through my CD collection the last few days, looking for gaps I need to correct
I'm a music and movie junkie, can't get enough, good or bad
I'm partial to romantic/comedies and Sci/Fi as far as movies go, but my musical tastes are much more varied
Thus, the gaps
Things I enjoy, which I just don't have the time or money to find and procure
With all the free time I have, and the help of my Amazon
com Wish List, I have begun to at least decide on a few things I will need to get when I have the money
The first things I will focus on are Country and Reggae
I went through a big Reggae phase in middle school, but I never bought the artists I liked when I switched over to CD's
Had a lot of them on downloads, but downloading has become so chancy, and I cannot afford to be sued in my near-destitute state
Country music is one of those things where I have a certain small group of artists in the form that I enjoy, and most of the rest of it drives me nuts
I am, however, being dragged to see Gretchen Wilson later this summer, so I figure I should at least get that
All I have right now is Mary Chapin-Carpenter and Nanci Griffith, who is really more rockabilly, which is of course my favorite portion of Country music
I'm going to have to buy a Brad Paisley CD for a friend (ick) but if I ever try to buy Brooks and Dunn, just take me out and shoot me
Alright, I'd better get going or I'm going to miss the infamous erratic mid-afternoon bus to the Metro
Gotta love public transportation
Squirrel out
Another question: What about blogs for information gathering? I'm thinking about people we know reading each other's blogs to find out personal information to be angry about, internet 'yelling' at each other because of something they said on a blog, etc
It's almost like snooping, except it's public
I also think about (and by the way I would never do this), how once I was looking at my blog on your laptop for some reason (I think I was downloading Framemaker on my computer), and your personal entries showed up
I of course didn't read them, but it's interesting how a public object (or maybe it's a private object) isn't so public, or private at all
And that's the nature of blogs
They are this amazing intersection between what have long been considered strictly public or private practices
But how private are journals anyway? We archive them in libraries, we read them published as books, we sometimes steal each others' for bribery
Interesting interesting
I also thought about how if someone stumbled on my personal blog, they could probably find out who I was by either the times I've mentioned the University of Illinois or linked to Shawn or E who mention the town, the University, and other such things often
How many Hannahs are there in the English department? Exactly
And if you know my first name and some of my interests, you can find my blog in 10 links on Google
So how private is it? But then again, how public? Who would want to read it? Are my personal thoughts really of that much interest to people? If I'm unimportant, than so is my blog
The recent pick of John Edwards (which, I think, is a massive asset to the dems, and creating a hugely powerful ticket-- one which, I'd play slightly better than even odds for winning in november) underscores one of the most divisive issues to the Dem party in America: Globalization
Kerry, as a successor to the Clintonites, has been pro, claims that it allows the US to specialize, and bring democratizing capital to the third world; Edwards, whose mildly protectionist rhetoric during the debates shows him as more of a anti, claims that it ends up forcing the US to be friends with some rather unscrupulous people, and allows more outsourcing
There are clear economic and political advantages to globalization-- it allows the US to cut costs by using cheaper international labor, but supply-side economics only goes so far
it does create a intricate web of dependencies which the US benefits from as much as it forces us into certain
strange alliances
ahem Saudi Arabia
But on the foreign side, third world labor markets benefit immensely from American investments, specifically because they don't have as many regulations governing treatement of workers, minimum wage, etc
and that may be a potential human rights disaster in which the United States economy is complicit, or worse encouraging
But with a strong ticket that combines both pro-globalizing and mildly protectionist policitians, and with an entirely gun-ho corporate globalizing ticket on the other side, it seems rather unlikely that the United States will do anything to jepordize global capital in the next four years
Regardless of your stance on the globalization of capital, what clearly needs to happen is some form of global oversight of third world markets-- to make sure that, while values about how much minimum wage should be, or if it should be at all, nobody becomes a virtual surf in a third world feifdom headed by terrible people with penchants for using American capital to finance further abuses
But this cannot be done unilaterally-  no single nation, especially not the United States at this time, has the power, influence or support to either start an oversight body or empower the current
shall I say fledgling
oversight bodies to do what needs to be done
Here is the results of an interesting personality test
Even though it doesn't sound real good
it is true
Wackiness: 52/100 Rationality: 40/100 Constructiveness: 72/100 Leadership: 46/100    You are an SECF-- Sober Emotional Constructive Follower
This makes you a  hippie
You are passionate about your causes and steadfast in your commitments
Once you've made up your mind, no one can convince you otherwise
Your politics are left-leaning, and your lifestyle choices decidedly temperate and chaste
You do tremendous work when focused, but usually you operate somewhat distracted
You blow hot and cold, and while you normally endeavor on the side of goodness and truth, you have a massive mean streak which is not to be taken lightly
You don't get mad, you get even

I did a quick grocery shop this afternoon at Foodtown; we needed milk, fresh fruit and veg, biscuits, cereal - the usual
&nbsp; I was playing that game, you know the one where you look at people's trolleys and try to work out what kind of people they are from what they are buying
&nbsp; There was the old lady in the queue in front of me with half a cabbage, a packet of rice and 6 tins of cat food, there was the couple&nbsp; velcroed together&nbsp;behind me with three bottles of wine and a packet of timtams
&nbsp; And there was me with my foodtown card at the ready, making sure I got all the discounts, sending off my details into the ether so some analyst could categorise me as a female family shopper (high spend, aspirational) and tailor coupons for wine and spaghetti sauce and anti-wrinkle cream to send me in the mail

Aarrgh !  I usually don't mind the ads that appear at the top of my blog, but one keeps showing up that really bugs me
Apparently it is a link to someone selling books by the Professor

It's TOLKIEN, TOLKIEN, TOLKIEN

Earth and Bey0nd   It is with a heavy heart that I write this
This past 1 of Feb, the dream of thousands was shattered and put on hold, and for the 7 member crew of the Space Shuttle Columbia, ended
I always had a fascination with Space
As a young child I would read up on the subject and would stare at the night sky for hours, a habit that I still continue today
In primary school when the Yong Scientist  award scheme was introduced, I tried out for 4 different fields but only managed to get the award for astronomy
It was in this interest that I naturally branched out into reading Science Fiction
I remember that faithful year
I had just turned 7 and it was to be a sign of a life changing year for me
The space program had been going full force with the shuttle project after a successful run on the Apollo program
Morale was high and a fleet of shuttles was commissioned after the successful testing of the Enterprise
Two shuttles had already been put into active duty with another 2 on the way
It was the second shuttle that I watched on TV that day as it climbed into the sky only to end in a fiery 3 part fireball
The Challenger disaster
It was also a day of firsts, the first teacher was on board and a first step into making space travel more open to the public
Now the first shuttle has followed it's sister and it took along another first
The first Israeli astronaut
In what what was to be a great symbol for peace and unity, ended in a blaze of fiery flame
It does not bode well for mankind
Nor for the space program
With the hope of a space program to Mars in 2010, there was a hope to take our minds off the troubles on Earth
Of famine, of fear and of war
I had imagined to be able to see mankind living off Earth by the time of my grandchildren, and perhaps have my ashes sent towards the edge of our solar system, in the final eternal journey of discovery
Now it looks like the space program would be set back another 40 years
And with growing tensions planetside, we may never leave earth orbit again
We may never live among the stars nor be buried in the fields of space, like the heroes before us, who have made it all possible
Please stop following me - you yeasty, diseased, wretch: The neighbors called Hazmat to come and check for a hazardous waste spill and I had to explain to them that  no, that was the stench of SUSAN's COOTCH that was making everyone walk around gagging
They did not believe that such a vomitrocious odor could eminate from a 'human' vagina, and conituned to search for the source of the fetid haze for over an hour
Little Lucy had to be hospitalized, and they might remove her left lung
See what your frothy skank hole has done?  Love,  This Girl
the topic of the day is Easter
What is it all aboutwell Easter dinner of course
Well, Jesus yes, but dinner is a close second
I've been pondering the whole Tofurkey issue since my induction into vegetarianism, at which point I'd suddenly transformed myself into a huge pain in the ass to each and every waitress and also to anyone who ever wants to break bread with us
Especially since, being vegan in Northeastern Ohio is akin to having a purple tongue and no eyelashesThis is how the process of inviting someone for dinner goes'hi, we were just wondering if you'd like to join us for dinner' 'oh gee, that  sounds nice! What are you making?' 'Some veggie enchiladas' at which point I add hurriedly 'I swear there's just a little tofu, you can't even taste it' 'yea, hmmyou know what, I've already got something in the oven, can we take a rain check?' My parents roll their eyes and chalk it up to quirkiness, my husband fears I've been pulled into a cult of malnourished, tree hugging, Berk sporting, anti-fur, carrot-suckers and expresses his dissatisfaction by occasionally calling me 'Dharma
' So enough about me, let's talk tofurkey
it's not that I'm really excited about diving into the whole realm of processed imitation meateven if the idea of 'fake wishbones' really does intrigue me
I think it's just the name that really floats my boat
I realized after having heard it the first time that 'tofurkey' can actually be utilized in a variety of ways in the English language
as adverbs 'don't walk so tofurkily' as an insult 'you are the biggest tofurkey ever' as a verb 'Ill tofurkey you if it's the last thing I do!' or as a noun 'let's make wild passionate Tofurkey'
This is all well and good but I'm not ready to go so far as to baste and June Cleaver in the kitchen all day, to have it sit ignored and dejected on the table, in all of it's loafy, gelatinous, soggy, cardboard-tasting, looks-like-a- dead-raccoon stuffed-into-pantyhose- and-cooked- for-40-minutes, splendor
So for now, I think I'll be safe and bypass the whole Tofurkey deal and stick with some scalloped tators and screw tradition with a nice steaming bowl of veggie chili while everyone chows on down on their triglyceride-rich Eckridge Farms hog carcass
ahh American traditions
And I still have awhile to ponder all of this before Thanksgiving
until then I plan to find out whether Tofurkeys have a faux anus, if notwhere else would you shove the stuffing???
I'm leaving again tomorrow afternoon for another camping expedition, this one will last longer than the last and you probably won't be hearing again from me until Sunday night
Seeing as how a prolonged lack of Reality Sandwiches can be dangerous to your health ( and usually I prefer to make a post or 2 per day), I've made it a point to create a post that will surely stay fresh for the period of time during which I'll be gone

Sorry I haven't posted in like a few days
&nbsp; Here are some updates:  &nbsp;  I am happy again!&nbsp; My computer isn't slow anymore, not because of DELL, but me
&nbsp; Yes, I thought up such an ingenious plan and it worked!  &nbsp;  I went to party on Saturday night, a graduation party for my friend Ashley
&nbsp; It was great
&nbsp; We played manhunt most of the night and during the day, we made a movie
&nbsp; The only bad part: I have over 25 mosquito bites on my legs and arms combined!&nbsp; Ouch!&nbsp; I do get 'pleasure' from scratching them, however
Any plans for the weekend?&nbsp; Give me a call as I always lose your number 'cause I suck at organizing things
&nbsp; For real, we want to come to Madison and see you
&nbsp; Don't laugh at my fat rolls, though
&nbsp; I'm back up to 130
&nbsp; BUT I started working out, so soon I'll be normal
Shit!&nbsp; I just realized how awful that was
&nbsp; You have so many posts about your family talking about people being overweight
&nbsp; Sorry
&nbsp; I don't focus on other people's size
&nbsp;&nbsp;I just obsess over my own
&nbsp; Is that any better?
damn M4! gt stck in a traffic jam for about an hour cos a horse box and tipped ova *still nt sure if horse was killed* I have a nu fone! YAY! nt the 1 i ordered off amazon but one a cople of models down from that one! its a motorola C550
it has a camera and other cool stuff aswell
i have my shoes and my bag for the ball now
the shoes are ivory coloured and the bag is lilac * we couldnt get any lilac of silver shoes that were suitable* doin nowt tomoz! YAY! but am goin round emzs on thurs and then to andreas bday prty on fri and then wrk on sat and then c/w sun!! o well
Went surfing after a hiatus of about 3 weeks
My arms are about to fall off
There were two dolphins playing in the water near us
One of them decided to jump so close that I felt the water moving aroung my legs while I was sitting on my board
It scared the shit out of me
Those guys are pretty big, if one of them was to run into me or decide to take a nip at me, I'd probably drown from the shock
I absolutely despise text messaging
It is the AIDS of wireless internet
Seriously
This has to be one of the shittiest ideas in the history of the world
First of all, almost every text message I've ever got looked like it was typed out by an autistic lobotomy patient
You know the type: 'hey wz^ nm here brb lol' I can understand an abbreviation every once in a while but this shit doesn't even make sense! I could type a more coherent message by bashing my head against the keyboard right now
You're probably saying something like 'but charles itz 2 hard 2 typ da hole werd lol!!!111' Well, if it's too hard to type the whole word, then it's too hard for me to read it
Which brings up another point:  There's nothing worse then people who think text messaging is supposed to be like a messenger program on the computer
These people text message you just to say 'hey
' You've got a cell-phone in your hand, dickwad, if you wanna say 'hey' you can fucking call me! I'm sick of getting text messages with no point to them
It's too much trouble to sit there and type back on forth to you on my cell phone when I could just as easily call you
Every time I get a message like that my blood temperature raises another 1/2 a degree
Another thing that really pisses me off is when you get an 'urgent' text message while you're driving
You know, the kind where your phone goes into an eliptic seizure once you receive it
It beeps and flashes like a bad anime show (yes, I know it's redundant to say 'bad anime')
You swerve all over the road to check it and it turns out somebody just wanted to say 'hey
' That's not urgent you asswipe! If I ever have a wreck because of this, I swear to God I will sue you until you have to live UNDERNEATH the streets
And don't bother text messaging me just to piss me off after you read this, because I'm not even fucking around
I will run you over with my car, and then clean the bloody spot off with your skull
BUST-ED
Say NO MORE
SOOOO excited! Imagine my surprise when on wednsday evening i come down the stairs to see who is at the door and its
JEANETTE! I screamed and like fell down the stairs to hug her! I was so surprised,she wasnt supposed to be back untill June when I was leaveing and we were all bumed out b/c we wouldnt get to see eachother! YAY! So she came and picked me up and took me back to her house where she talked non-stop about North Carolina which is cool
Everyone was shocked to hear that she was back
YAY! And dont you ever run away agian!!! -Other news- Im starting this new Global studies thing which is actually pretty interesting if you can belive that! And also a cosmotology course which is an independent study,looks pretty spiffy if you ask me but i havent started it yet

Yes, I've started a blog too
It's supposed to help me improve my essay writing skills in the long run (yeah right)
Having a blog is fast becoming an 'in' thing with the crowd
And I'm here to join in the fad
To check out the rush
In exchange, my life is put on the display board
My blog title is actually adapted from the Jim Dunlop motto - 'Live To Play Live'
Was just browsing through their website and was especially attracted to the picks section
Many famous stars use Dunlop picks for their style of playing too
Metallica, Hoobastank, Korn, Avril Lavigne, Linkin Park, Blink 182, DefTones, Sum 41, AudioSlave, Good Charlotte, just to name a few
I  urlLink also  saw  The Fog of War  this weekend
Watching next to Julian and Lindsay was great fun, because there was a lot of incredulous arm waving and quizzical head tilting when McNamara used excuses like, 'I was carrying out the orders of an elected president
'  Despite the occasional odor of burning pants, however, we agreed that McNamara comes off as pretty sympathetic

What happened?  I missed something completely apperently
Namely where Abby was offended, never saw that post
Rosie gave me the assignments I asked for (thank you by the way, saved me a lot of time) and then we started talking about Abby's thumb (hope it's feeling better, btw)
So what happened?  I'm going to fix this real quick
Abby, Rosie apologizes for whatever she did that upset you (You were mad? You've got to tell me these things when I talk to you!) (And Rosie, it wouldn't hurt you to actually apologize
I'll respond to the stuff on the other blog there, cause I've definitely got some things to say there
)  Rosie, Abby accepts your apology
Josh, we're not supposed to call friends 'ass'  Use something more discreet like 'butt' or 'donkey' whichever you meant it to be
Or call her something in Finnish
She'll never know
I'm pretty sure I have a topic nailed down for my paper, so that's starting to look better
Mostly, I'm exhausted from reading too late last night (a school book, even!), and getting up a bit too early
Add in a few glasses of sherry, and I'm ready to pass out
I'm getting up early to make up for the missed late night work
Good night all!
So this same night at Seven, I had an interesting discussion with a Korean man who works as a bodyguard
He spoke a bit about North Korea, which I don't really hear much about from most Koreans
He told me that most Koreans underestimate Kim Jong Il and North Korea
The owner, he said, all he cares about is women
He - most Korean people - they don't think about serious things
They don't realize how important it is to have the American army in South Korea
Kim Jong Il, he told me, is a very dangerous man, as dangerous as Saddam Hussein and Bin Laden
Korea is a very dangerous place, he said
Things could become bad very fast, and I should go back to Canada quickly
This is the first time I've ever heard anything seriously negative from a Korean about the North, and the first time a Korean told me they really supported the presence of American soldiers
Something for me to think about

only him, through his rose colored glasses can possibly see me that way
i move deeper, thrusting, moaning
begging for him to fill me up, soothe my hunger, quench my thirst
he holds me tight for a while
a long while, wanting to soak in all the moments that have build up to this moment, the night before
he leaves in less than twentyfour hours, a journey of sorts, a voyage he makes yearly right around the bikini season
our respective places we need to be, comforts, i fight against time and the tears that always seem to well up at the perfectly stupid moments
he leaves bits and pieces of him around the house, our home that we've been building on for the last seven months
a place we've stopped halfway since we begin a year and a half ago
he centers the porch swing a little bit more so that i look into the garden instead of the traffic on nine in moments where i am craving for solitude and tranquility
and while he packs, he rearranges things to my liking, things i have compromised over and it is like the finality of knowing that he is going
in bed, he talks to sasquatch and ziggi as if they are people, telling them that they need to take care of me
like my less than two feet cat and dog are going to protect me, all the same anyway, i suppose they will keep me company
he came home last week with a surprise he said, his eyes twinkling and him grinning from ear to ear
he leads me into our bedroom and on the sidetable he's purchased a beta fish and gently lowered him down into a glass tank filled with crystals at the bottom
it's my responsibility now to feed it he says, as he leaves instructions for all the other things that need to be taken cared of around here
the things i usually leave up to him, the things i generally don't really bother with
it's funny how much independence you sometimes lose when you learn to work as a team, i can't quite remember what it's like anymore to have dinner alone or not go grocery shopping with him in mind
who am i going to buy string cheese and cases of dr
pepper for? who is going to pull the covers over me when i've mastered the art of kicking them off? who's going to turn off my light and put my book back on the table?   i don't think i remember how to make dinner for just one, or dinner that isn't too spicy or weird
i've mastered the art of fusion, of mixing asian and american spices into something decent
the summer brings freedom, of doing what we feel like doing because we want to do it
of less laundry and dishes but more complication and so much loneliness
i've been reading through the last couple of posts, of episodes and episodes of sinking into a dark place and how he's helped pulled me through all those times
he's delaying his departure tomorrow so he can go in with me to the doctor's to get my shots
i've left him to ask the questions, to grill the doctors, to say fucking fix her now you bloody idiots
i'll miss you
i'll miss knowing that you'll be home waiting for me when i go out
i'll miss telling you about my day and watching you do your silly dances
i'll miss your laughter, the way your whole face scrunches up or the way your beautiful gray eyes smile
i'll miss listening to you and stevie talk, when you're the cool older brother that's trying to be all stern and shit
i'll miss the way you're always out in the audience supporting me even if i don't see you, i'll miss knowing that you are just there
i'll miss coming home and finding little surprises along the way, i'll miss sitting by the beach and watching the sun go down with your arms around my waist and the waves washing onto the shore
i'll miss three am excursions to walmart for absolutely nothing and watching you at work
i'll miss fighting with you just to get my way, or poking fun at you
i'll miss tickling the bottom of your feet when you're asleep or wrestling in bed
i'll miss the way you know exactly what, exactly when
the way you kiss me when i don't expect it, the way you are okay with me being stupid or crazy or retarded or fucked up
i know i want him in my life for ever and ever and ever
i know i carry a piece of him everywhere that i go
i know that i adore him possibly even much more than he does me
i know what it means to be in love and to go through thick and thin
and then a little bit more
it's four o five in the morning and he's fallen asleep on the couch in our living room because he's waiting for me to get done with my shit so we can go to bed
i love just sitting here and looking at him, wanting to soak it all in
of how happy love makes me feel inside, that even through everything, there are strong arms that carry me along the way
i'm flying into jersey in about a month, we have a weekend away planned
in between the two summer terms of intense classes with notes flying out my ass
this is going to be another crazy summer
i fly back somewhere in august to malaysia, it's the first year i've missed the cheerleading finals and some nostalgic memory chokes me up
i am only scheduled for two weeks at home and that does not seem to be even nearly enough
there's so many things that i want to do, people and places
i turn twenty this october, does it seem as weird to you that i've been here for twenty freaking goddamn years? sometimes, i feel like i haven't accomplished enough, yet there are moments where i know that i've come a long long way from where i couldn't possibly imagine i would end
so here's to summer and life, for all the quirks it sends along the way and all the brickbats we somehow stumble through

&nbsp; From what I've heard though, UT is a homosexual and lesbian school
God I hope not! I don't have anything against gays and lesbians because I have a lot of gay friends
It's just that I want a boyfriend too! I'm sure there will be tons of hot guys though
Let's cross our fingers and hold our breath!
Now, I know it's been awhile
and I've received a few complaints
To my adoring fans who have felt neglected, I sincerely apologize
But please realize how easy it is to be The Black Blossom, how easy it is to never be removed from my unique and brilliant banter
I don't know what it's like to not have myself around, so I'm always happy and laughing -- so please forgive my thoughtlessness
Now, the first and only order of business today is to publicly establish the parameters of 'the perfect woman' -- I am doing this not only because I constantly have young women pounding on my door, calling my phone, and leaving notes for me at work and on my car, but also because I don't like any of these women
To the layman, I might appear to be somewhat of a loner -- a sophisticated eye, however, will discover that I am simply very picky
I know what I want, and I don't settle for anything else
All of that said, who am I looking for?  Essentially, I am looking for Sigourney Weaver's character of Ripley from 'Aliens'
Let's make this supremely clear: I am not looking for Sigourney Weaver, I am not looking for Ripley from 'Alien', 'Alien 3', or 'Alien: Resurrection'
I am looking for Ripley from 'Aliens'
Do not say I have a crush on Sigourney Weaver
She's an attractive lady, but she's no Ripley
What do I appreciate about Ripley in 'Aliens'?  Well, let's start with the superficial
She's a hot lady
The Black Blossom appreciates beauty
But hot ladies are a dime a dozen, especially here in Arizona
You're going to have to be more than hot to snag The Black Blossom
I can get hot by walking outside -- so if you think your spaghetti straps and thong underwear rising over your jeans is going to get me all riled up, think again
A clone of you and your style will reappear within five minutes, and you will be forgotten instantly, replaced by another globule of American beach style
Not impressed
I'm glad you're hot, and make no mistake, I'll look at you, but don't think I'm going to talk to you, much less be nice to you or appreciate you at all unless you're smart and tough like Ripley
Beauty is not a pass, so don't flash it at my door thinking you'll get in
You'll get bounced faster than a Bob Cousy dribble pass
That's right, you saw me write 'tough and smart'
That's what I want
I want a woman that can spot a corporate sleazeball
I want a woman that doesn't take any shit from unethical assholes
I want a woman that knows her books, knows her movies, and in general, just plain-ass knows her shit
She also has to know that she knows her shit
Most importantly, I want a woman that will, (if the need arises), duct-tape a flamethrower to a machine gun and invade hostile alien territory
(She doesn't have to know HOW to use a machine-gun or a flamethrower, necessarily
She just has to be willing to pick them up and use them if a small innocent girl is kidnapped by aliens
)  Manners are cool
I'm not looking for some 100 mile-an-hour lady that's going to kick my ass if I disagree with her, knows more dirty jokes than me, exclusively drinks whiskey and scratches her crotch in public
I'm not about that
I subscribe to a few ideas of femininity, for better or for worse, and maintaining a certain level of that is required
No monster truck enthusiasts
No doily collectors either
Really, the best way to find out what I'm attracted to is to watch 'Aliens'
If you think you fit the bill, go ahead and drop me a line
No fakers, I'll spot you -- I'm looking for a Ripley, not some farcical imitation
I hope this has helped
I'll be happy to answer questions
I hope this has helped in some capacity
I just got done eating finger steaks and cheesy potatoe and bacon soup
The finger steaks are made by cutting up cube steaks into thin strips, rolling them in flour and then frying them in a skillet
I'm sure is more to it than that, but I don't cook
(The mum makes it)  And the potatoe soup
Well, the old man makes it and I'm not sure what all goes into it
But when its done, damn that is some good stuff
Its rather thick too and really isn't much like most soup
And paired with the finger steaks, its more like eating candy
Anyhow, the reason why the parents made it is because my grandparents came over today
Other than that, I finally got my room completely cleaned and sorted
Which means I am now fully unpacked
And it only took me about 3 1/2 months
Rather sad, no?

Here's an observation from John to explore
In my study we've spent two weeks now looking at ways that chapter five (the lame man healed at the Sheep Pool) and chapter nine (blind man healed at the Temple) correspond and contrast
Here's one for further reflection
The locations involved in the two stories are opposed as the plot unfolds
The lame man is found outside the city to the north by Jesus, healed, and then encountered again inside the Temple
The blind man is found near the Temple (Jesus is on his way out from nearly being stoned), healed, and then encountered again somewhere near the Pool of Siloam, almost outside the city to the south
A couple of interpretations present themselves
First, we must remember that the blind man conducts himself with faith in the Christ as the Pharisees interrogate him
He is rewarded by Jesus in hearing who the Christ is and believing
The lame man doesn't have much faith at all and is warned by Jesus to 'stop sinning or something worse will happen to you
'  Remembering this, it becomes evident that the miracles of Christ combining with faith move you closer to the Living Water, while scorning His works through disbelief will remove you from it
It was the blind man who got into the pool through faith and the hearing and obeying of Jesus' word
And the converse has implications too
Jesus is taking His disciples out of the Temple, for it will soon be destroyed
The old covenant is perishing because of the disbelief of its members
The lame man winds up in the Temple, suitable for destruction because of his disbelief
The blind man is thrown out, but that is a blessing because the Temple is not long for the world

Hey all, I don't mean to light the fire for a debate but I don't have a problem with abortion, and I don't see how abortion and the morning after pill differ in purpose of use
Whats the difference between stopping something thats going to exist than ceasing something that barely does
A pregnancy is the process of producing a baby, once a mommy and a daddy have sex and the sperm meets the egg that process begins
Whether a person recognizes the possibility of a baby earlier or later, the possibility and probability of a baby are the same in both situations
If one has to use the morning after pill to stop the inevitability of a baby growing, then it is obvious that the person taking the  pill beleives that a baby has been conceived, and wishes to cancel that conception
Cancelling the conception is taking the possibility of existence away from that baby
Now how does that differ from abortion? Due to that, I don't see how people can justify their negative views on abortion while supporting the morning after pill
When it comes down to it, both methods of ending a pregnancy are ways out for people who are not ready to become parents
And it is my personal opinion that a way out three days after conception does not differ from that of 3 weeks
-I love you guys,  Chris Mitchem
forget what i said yesterday for a moment

great time looking through those magazines at borders and commenting on whether the guys had pecs or some other more feminine feature

I don't think that spousal support should exist
Child support - yes - definitely!  But spousal - NO
When my husband of eleven years and I divorced, I didn't even think of asking for spousal
It takes two to make a marriage and it takes two to make a mess of it
I couldn't kick him out of my life and then also ask him to pay me on top of it all
That's what divorce is - isn't it?  Separating your two lives
You both have to move on
Having to pay every month for a woman you no longer have a relationship with doesn't allow for closure
I also wanted my independence
I needed to grow up and make it on my own without his financial help
I'm an adult
He doesn't owe me a thing
My new husband however pays $400
00 a month in spousal support
The length of his relationship with his ex was four years and they were commonlaw - not legally married
I'm sorry if this offends any of you, but to me there is a big difference
Anyway, he has to pay her this amount for four years
My question is
what did she do to deserve this money?  Why is she entitled to control his pocketbook after their seperation?  Why do I have to go to work daily so that she can live comfortably?    We recently figured out that he'd been overpaying her
We worked it all out and decided that next year he only needs to give her between 35 (my figure) and 75(his figure) dollars a month
So he takes her all the paperwork yesterday and lets her know that in January her cheques will be for one hundred dollars each month
Why did he feel the need to round up?  Maybe it's good for his ego to be able to say that he takes care of two families
I dunno
If he was paying her to stay out of our lives forever, it might be worth it, but she's still there
everyday
taunting me
The resentment is building and I fear that one day I'm going to lose it
Last night when I tucked my daughter into bed she said to me; 'Mommy, I just love your face!'  and at that moment I didn't have a care in the world

I ran across a old checkbook today and it got me to thinking about the revolving account I have had for a long, long time
This isn't any ordinary account although it was setup and established for me way back before I was even created
This revolving account is so special to me because no matter how many times I check the balance it always has enough funds to cover my every need
I have never overdrawn this account, I must say I had not always been consistent with my deposits either
I am so glad that the Bank Manager knows me so well that he would already have my check register and balance sheet corrected and back on track, before I had caused myself too much grief
There had been times when I took things for granted and I didn't think much of this account; I would misplace my check register and I also would not care whose ATM I used as long as I got what I needed at that moment
I would get caught-up and tied up with a different banks that just charged me an arm and a leg in fees and penalties
What made it worse is that I never really was satisfied with their service, but I would feel bad and embarrassed to have gotten in such a mess but somehow I always made it back to my original banking institution and would have to reconcile my carelessness and start afresh and once again my Bank Manager would be waiting to return my well balanced and intact account back to me
I am so thankful for my revolving account which is managed by the Awesome Bank Manager, Jesus Christ
Now the question is,Who are you banking with?
Abordo, *sigh* what did i ever do? I'm not 'always confused'
It would help if people stopped insulting me
I am on happy pills though

So guess what procrastination cost me this week
Almost $400, two days of work and another test of my wife's patience
You see, a few months back, I got pulled over in the '84 Grand Marquis (heretofore known as the Clunker) for something to do with the inspection sticker
I forgot, when I registered the car in October to have it inspected
The hyper-aware policeman that was protecting the streets of Andover that day, noticed that the sticker didn't match
something
End result: I got pulled over, told to get the car inspected and given a $25
00 ticket for not wearing my seatbelt
So I got the car inspected a week later (it failed) and was supposed to do something about it by the middle of May
Those of you who have an idea of the crazy schedule I have, know how easy it would be for me to forget to get the car fixed and pay the seatbelt citation
This past Monday, I got pulled over for the inspection sticker, was informed that my license had been suspended and the Clunker was towed away
If the best you can say about anything that happens to you before 8 o'clock is 'Well, at least I didn't get arrested
' then your life needs some serious re-assessment
It is Friday and I have paid the citation, gotten my license reinstated and retrieved the Clunker from the impound yard
There is no doubt that my life is in need of some serious re-assessment
I have no time, though
Between commuting to and from both jobs, all to frequent doctor appointments and quality time with the kids, I barely have time to commute to both jobs, go to doctor appointments or spend time with the kids

Well yesterday began my IE adventure weekend
I rolled into Moreno Valley in the early afternoon and spent some quality time with Nathan
Then it was over to Will's to eat a yummy BBQ chicken pizza from Trader Joe's and watch some tv while reading some great materials
We decided to venture out into the city and went to Back to the Grind for some coffee and then for a nice long chat and walk
We had a great bonding session
Will is definitely a fun and interesting guy
Came back late and had a visit from Nathan then I read a bit more of Blackwood Farm and it was off to bed
I had a wonderful sleep and awoke without an alarm, very cool
I spent the day lounging in the wonderful IE sun, visiting with Rocko and Padington, I think I have a new admirerer in Rocko, hehe, watch out Nathan
Anyway, I had a great relaxing day and finished JP from cover to cover, good issue
Then it was on to BF, that book is amazing, I think Anne did and excellent job with this one
I fell asleep while reading and had the most wild dreams, it was great
So now Will is back and we're getting ready for another night of extreme fun
Thanks Will, he's such an awesome host! I'm so very glad that I met him and tht we are getting the chance to get to know each other better, he's one crazy cool cat! Lates!

frozen   i was moving backwards steadily fast returning home  by intercity, yester-evening  i could see in the field, the bunch of trees   running away from me  left me nothin but the freezin' breeze    [iced me within the hands of time]    i could see in the sky, the white clouds   drawning away from me  left me nothin but the freezin' shrouds    [iced me within the hands of time]     and though the sun got itself girthed, but i could still see the bright shining path down to earth, as a blessing on me     [rotterdam-denhaag-delft]

Kuronue:  Hey!  My eyes glow red and by many standards, I am evil!  I'm deciding whether I should run or fight you guys
By the way, most demons' eyes glow
Especially in the dark or during immense frustration
There is no such things as free lunch
This probably best describes the greed in every one of us
No single person is unselfish
Everyone wants something for something everytime, all the time
They just want it in different ways
Unconvinced? What about those people who do charity work? Those who devote their time and energy so that they can make other people's lives better
I'm not talking about those hypocrites who live a double life
I'm talking about those genuine ones, those who don't want something in return
Oh no but they do, maybe not in the way we consider as greed but they do it because they feel something good inside
And that is getting something out of doing something to someone
Our whole life is a business investment
When we do something, it's a business transaction
It's like barter
Alright, I save your life what's in it for me
Ahm, you'll now have a life supply of feelings of heroism running through your veins
You will also get, tadaaaan! 1000 good points that you can claim during Judgement Day
Those fools who decided money as profits are shortsighted
A good businessman doesn't invest on something that won't have any value after a few snaps
If you know what you want then have a plan and do it
And I'm telling you, everybody wants something
Those who want to prove that you can do something without wanting in return must be ready to waste their whole life
Once you go on proving this, you already disproved it

So I'm sick as a dog and tired and feverish and I'm only online so I might get to talk to Talyor, Trevor's friend, who might be taking him to chruch
If he doesn't take him, he'll at least be there and can give him a message for me
I hope I get a message to him
He's got a wrestling meet at 5:30 and will have to rush to even make any of church
I don't want him to rush if he doesn't have to
He likes chruch, but he has a paper to do and he's only coming cause he thinks I'll be there
I don't want him to have to rush for almost nothing
And then he'll want to come see me and I can't let him do that
I'm sick
I don't want him to get sick
I feel really really crappy, I don't want him feeling really really crappy too
If he comes over he'll want to hug me and comfort me and that'd make him sick too
Hince the badness of him coming over
That's all

com - Man's chainsaw tumble kills wife - Aug 4, 2004   Geeze, it's just not a good year to be a wife, eh?
I checked my e-mail a couple mins ago and just got a forward from someone in my department saying to watch the news tonight because they will be reading the names all everyone who has died in Iraq
I am completly against the war and could go off about all that, but I don't want to right now
Right now, my heart is in my throat and I have tears in my eyes
My ex-girlfriend and I broke up last July
It was my choice and I it was definitally for the best
It was a little bit of a hard break up (not as bad as others I've had, but not easy)
I haven't spoken to her since maybe August and have tried to move on
I met her when I was living in Hawaii
She, like most lesbians in Hawaii, is in the military
I generally don't date military, but made an exception for her
We had a rocky relationship (though she will deny this) which ended me me begging her to date other people
Last time I talked to her she told me that she was supposed to go to Afgahnastan in Feb
I don't know if she ever went or what is going on
But based on the fact that they're trying to re-institute the draft, I think just about everyone is over there
I would e-mail her, but I don't want to make contact again
I'll write more about her later, but not right now
Even though I thought that I was over her, when I got that e-mail, my heart skipped a beat
I went down the list of names getting more pannicked as I got closer to the C's
She wasn't there (thank god)
But, now I'm just anxious and upset
I want so badly to know where she is and if she's ok, but I don't know how to figure it out
It's funny, relationships can be long passed and you can think you're over someone, but then someting happens, and all that emotion comes flooding back
All you want to know is are they ok, and are they happy
All we want is a head rush All we want is to get out of our skin for awhile We have nothing to lose because we don’t have anything Anything we want anyway… We used to hate people Now we just make fun of them It’s more effective that way We don’t live We just scratch on day to day With nothing but matchbooks and sarcasm in our pockets And all we’re waiting for it is for something worth waiting for Let’s admit America gets the celebrities we deserve Let’s stop saying “don’t quote me” because if none quotes you You probably haven’t said a thing worth saying We need something to kill the pain of all that nothing inside We all just want to die a little bit We fear that pop-culture is the only kind of culture we’re ever going to have We want to stop reading magazines Stop watching TV Stop caring about Hollywood But we’re addicted to the things we hate We don’t run Washington and no one really does Ask not what you can do for your country Ask what your country did to you The only reason your still alive us because someone Has decided to let you live We owe so much money we’re not broke we’re broken We’re so poor we can’t even pay attention So what do you want? You want to be famous and rich and happy But your terrified you have nothing to offer this world Nothing to say and no way to say it But you can say it in three languages You are more than the sum of what you consume Desire is not an occupation You are alternately thrilled and desperate Sky-high and fucked Let’s stop praying for someone to save us and start saving ourselves Let’s stop this and start over Let’s go out Let’s keep going This is your life This is you fucking life We need something to kill the pain of all that nothing inside Quit whining you haven’t done anything wrong because frankly  You haven’t done much of anything Someone’s writing down your mistakes Someone’s documenting your downfall  -KMFDM

So I've been trying to figure out why I haven't been able to touch my manuscript when suddenly this dawned on me:  How can I write about something so sad, painful and horrifying when I am filled with low-awaited joy and contentment?  Several years ago, I read an essay written by an artist who specialized in capturing very dark moments in life through photography
She was bipolar and she believed that once she went on medication to control her illness, she was unable to continue with her work
She became frustrated and ultimately stopped taking the medication so she could feel her emotions once again and resume her photography
While I'm not anywhere near the point of abandoning my beloved manuscript, I do believe that a lot of the pain I had experienced over the last four years helped me to write about something so horrifying as the Holocaust
I'm not a self-proclaimed 'tortured artist' by any means; but studying the Holocaust all of these years has opened my eyes and heart to human suffering and any of the struggles I went through personally has helped me write from a suffering person's point-of-view with more feeling than I might have had without having had these experiences
Though the suffering is incomparable, I believe we all have pain thresholds and that the way in which we cope with bad experiences throughout life directly correlates to how much pain we feel as individuals
For once in my life I feel so fulfilled and it's very hard to want to go back to something as haunting as a little boy eating maggots in a ghetto to survive
I'm so close to finishing this draft
Maybe there is a part of me, too, that isn't ready to complete it
Maybe for now I'll just enjoy the sunshine
I just pray it doesn't take another string of bad experiences to get me to finish the book!
I read the following review while wearing my collection development/selection hat earlier this week at work
Considering some of the blog-and-comment discussions that have been flying recently, it might be of interest to more than just me
Title:  urlLink Necessary Dreams : Ambition in Women's Changing Lives  Author: Anna Fels   Available 6 April 2004 from Pantheon Books, $26
From  urlLink Publishers Weekly : 'While a psychiatrist's study of the 'vital role of ambition in women's changing lives' hardly sounds like absorbing reading, this book by Fels, an occasional science writer for the  New York Times  and other popular media, is surprisingly interesting
After introductory comments about how life has changed for modern women, thanks to increased longevity, birth control and other factors, Fels raises a curious question: why do women still feel anxious or evasive about admitting to having ambitions, but men don't? The answer lies in understanding that ambition has two components: the mastery of some specific skills and the recognition of that mastery by others
While many professions have opened to women in the 20th century, allowing them to learn a variety of skills, Fels says, women have still not found a plethora of sources for recognition, or ways of being valued by others for the special skills they've acquired
Lacking 'sustaining affirmation,' women sometimes settle for mere attention -- sexual attention being the easiest -- or 'recognition by proxy,' reflected glory from the accomplishments of husband or children
Men, on the other hand, Fels finds, have traditionally had a wide range of sources -- colleagues, mentors, friends, family, spouse -- for 'affirming attention
' As Fels examines the mixed messages women get about claiming recognition (especially the taboos on outshining one's husband or appearing less than devoted to child-rearing), women readers may see their own goal problems more clearly
This book isn't sexy, nor is it self-help, but career women -- or anyone raising smart daughters to do big things -- will find a lot within its pages to think about and discuss

Hi! I am back! Don’t know where’s Harry
Been a long time since I last visited this place, where I vent out my frustration
This doesn’t mean that I was not pissed off with people or I was not frustrated all through this time
It’s just that I was too busy with my sorry life
Anyway, there is nothing new to write about
It’s just the same old story
I work like an ass from Monday to Friday and party like a devil in the weekends
Talking about reincarnation Ha? I am a live example
That reminds me, I had a really different experience last weekend
As I told you, I turn into a devil in weekends
My friends like to call me ‘Hellboy’
They often ask, “What happens to you when you enter that nightclub? You lose all your ‘nice guy’ image and dance as if there’s no tomorrow!” And I always tell them to “Shut up”  Anyway, moving ahead
So I was in this nightclub and there’s something about those lights flickering brightly on the floor and on the sweaty faces and on the shining hair and on the sexy clothes and everywhere else
This mixed with the music and the acoustic system transforms me to a devil
And I like a wolf hunt for my prey
But just like a hunter, whose every chase does not end up with a kill, I was also chasing and trying until I landed up with a babe, who I later realized was from my office
It was too late by then actually
The darkness of the floor and my devilish attitude found the groove
Won’t elaborate on the details
It was for my pleasure not yours
But just like all good things come to an end, so did the night with the sun coming out again and all the creatures of the night like me retreated back to their dwellings
And then I woke up
I have taken many lousy trips in life, but the GUILT TRIP is the most horrific
Once I woke up and was transforming into an ass again, I realized what I had done the night before
I almost screamed
My heartbeat was faster than the drums playing in the Hard Rock Café
My face was whiter than Michael Jackson
Hair (everywhere) were standing on their ends and I was looking like a freak from Ripley’s Believe It Or Not
My roommate almost died with fright (I wish he had)
He asked me, “What’s wrong with you?” I asked him if he remembered what I did
He said, “Hell yes, the whole world knows about it
I would be surprised if you are not in the evening news
” He thought it was funny
I gave him a stern look again and said, “Did I do anything……you know……kind of…
vulgarish sort of……thing” He gave me that grin, which makes  you feel like beating the crap out of that jerk
He was happy that my doomsday is soon approaching on Monday
Anyway, I tried coping with the nightmares that night
When I reached office, everything seemed to be eerily calm
People were faking to be nice just like always and all seemed to be already transformed into asses for the next five days
So their heads were inside their monitors
And they perhaps didn’t even realize that I was around
And then that babe came
And I didn’t even want to think what happens next
But she saw me and then looked through me as if I don’t even exist
I got the point
And you can’t even imagine how relieved I felt
She was ignoring me and I started ignoring her
We are acting like strangers, like the two ships in the night that cross each other but don’t know who the other is
And I happily transformed into an ass again
Waiting for the next weekend to come
Well, the painting of the bathroom is complete
There are still some things that need to be done, like cleaning and putting some of the hardware back in, but it is done enough that we can use it again
WooHoo! I feel like I spent the whole last week inside that bathroom! :o)~  I'm finding it quite hard to get back into the swing of things this week
It's mostly the getting up in the morning that I'm having trouble with
I was able to sleep in as much as I wanted for two solid weeks and it's not easy to pull out of that habit! I'm making a committment as of today though - I will get up to have breakfast with Doug and I will not go back to bed after he leaves! Please feel free to ask me if I'm sticking to that
Tomorrow
or is it later today?  That is a ramble for another time I suppose
I intend on posting some more substantial information about myself, or rather I should say - the workings and rants of my mind, which are what this page is all about
I want to hook it up with some information about what my plans are over the long and short term periods I have before me
Til then, that dark place where my eyelids protect me calls
Today, after a quite lot of reading and experiments,I solved a problem about X
11 forwarding and SSH
It feels good
Living your life    as a frog    looking for life's cure    can lead to    an interesting discovery
Let me tell you    about the 2 princesses    that I was    able to meet
&nbsp;   The first has been    royalty to me    for 8 years
Always there to    make me laugh
&nbsp;    Always there to    dry my tears
I spent one-third    of my life    trying to protect    her from pain
I would rather die    than see her get    her feelings hurt again
&nbsp;   The second highness    is as close    to perfection    as I can see
And if you count    her sister then    princesses I know    will equal 3
I won't allow myself    to be wrong    for as long    as she's around
Because she gives    a friendship    that I know is right
Picks me up    when I'm down
&nbsp;   The most important    thing to know    about these future queens    is what makes them    princesses to me
Because a princess    is full of class and dignity    whose beauty never ends
Because with these 2,    No one is    good enough for them

Y'know, that's pretty good

[Joey visibly thinks 'Of course!' and writes it down]   Joey:  Joseph Stalin
I think you'd remember that!  Chandler:  Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin

Ross:  She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase
Apparently he's reached sexual maturity
Joey: [To Chandler]  Hey! He beat ya

This is Jane
I don't know if you're still at this number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it's been three years, but, I was kinda hoping we could hook up again
I barely had t he nerve to make this call, so you know what I did? CHANDLER:  What? JADE:  I got a little drunk
and naked
CHANDLER:  Bob here
CHANDLER:  (on phone) What've you been up to? JADE: Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much
Oh, and in case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster
CHANDLER:  Can you hold on a moment?  I have another call
(to Ross) I love her
ROSS:  I know
CHANDLER:  I'm back
JADE:  So, are we gonna get together or what? CHANDLER:  Um, absolutely
Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon?  Do you know  uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish? JADE:  Great, I'll see you then
CHANDLER:  Ok
Having a phone has finally paid off
ROSS: Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, 'hey, you're not Bob
' CHANDLER: I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table
ROSS:  Oh my god
You are pure evil
CHANDLER:  Ok, pure evil, horny and alone
I've done this
MONICA: I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti

Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today
ROSS:  Whoa!  You had sex today?           CHANDLER: Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it
I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming
ROSS:  Wow

I never have to answer that phone again

Listen, I just wanted to tell you that I was really hurt when you didn't show up the other day, and just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy
CHANDLER:  Bob here
JADE:  Oh, hi
CHANDLER:  So, uh, you met someone, huh? JADE:  Yes, yes, I did
In fact, I had sex with him 2 hours ago
CHANDLER:  So, uh, how was he? JADE:  Eh
CHANDLER:  Eh? JADE:  Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you
I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name
CHANDLER:  Well, that makes me feel so good
JADE:  It was just so awkward and bumpy
ROSS:  (silently mouthing) Bumpy? CHANDLER: Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with
And uh maybe you have to get used to it
JADE:  Well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean?               RACHEL:  Who gave you that hickey? MONICA:  That would be the work of a Blowfish
RACHEL:  Oh! PHOEBE: Oh! I can't believe it
I can't believe this
We're just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, 'hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck'
CHANDLER:  [singing to the tune of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]  Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor
JOEY: Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever
MONICA:  [entering]  All right
Tell me if this is too cute
Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts
RACHEL: Oh god
I think I'm gonna be sick
MONICA: Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them
MRS GREEN: This is so much fun, just the girls
You know what we should do? Does anybody have any marijuana? RACHEL: God! MONICA: All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food
MRS GREEN: That's fine
I never did it
I just thought I might
So, what's new in sex? RACHEL: Oh! What's new in sex? MRS GREEN: The only man I've ever been with is your father
MONICA: I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything
MRS GREEN: I mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but I was thinking there might be more
RACHEL: Oh, I'm sorry
You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you
I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy
What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing? MRS GREEN: No
RACHEL: You want me to talk you out of it? MRS GREEN: No
RACHEL: Then what? What do you want? MRS GREEN: I guess I just figured of all people you would understand this
RACHEL: Why on earth would I understand this? MRS GREEN: You didn't marry your Barry
RACHEL: Oh
MONICA: All right people, we're in trouble here
We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left
Move, move, move! CHANDLER: Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles
MONICA: Joey, speed it up! JOEY: I'm sorry, it's the pigs
they're reluctant to get in the blankets! PHOEBE: Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out
MONICA: Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry? PHOEBE: Sir! No sir! MONICA:  [to Ross]  All right, you! ROSS: No
Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing
MONICA: All right, look, Ross
I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do
But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called 'pigs in Ross'
All right, ball the melon
CHANDLER: Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon
JOEY: It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing
I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly
CHANDLER: Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding
CHANDLER:  [to the woman who just rejected him]  All right look
Penis schmenis
We're all people
[She walks away again
]                 heeheeehee
waay too much time on my hands
Wow, I just realized what poor grammar I have
I need to take a grammar class I think
That and punctuation
Damn commas
When DO you use those little things?
stayed home today
got my hair cut, bought packing tape, and got my renter's insurance paperwork signed
Am is on her way over now to watch some tv with me and help me pack
seems she grabbed some boxes from work for me
oh and she sent me a picture of the flowers i sent her
she still really likes them!  click  urlLink here  for picture
There is only one TV in my apartment that has cable and last night it was tuned to the Democratic National Convention
That's right the DNC
I'm pretty sure I have never watched a National Convention before and last night it became clear as to why that was the case
First, I should remind everyone how much distaste I have for politics
I have often said that I hate politics, but this is a stretch of the truth and only an easy way to say what I really mean
I don't like political nonsense! This comes mostly in the form of political propaganda, which is what the Repulican/Democratic National Convention is all about
On a lighter note I do have a couple of good things to say about the DNC
One good thing about democratic ticket is John Edwards
This guy seems to be a very genuine guy
When he talks it at least sounds like he believes all the propaganda BS coming out of his mouth and I can respect that
Choosing him as VP is probably John Kerry's brightest move in the campaign yet
Now we turn the tables and look at Kerry
I don't really see anything genuine coming out of this character
The question that I most recently posed was
'Is Kerry THE RIGHT candidate or is he just NOT THE WRONG candidate?' Feel free to look at this however you choose because that is what it is all about
choice
But it seems to me that everyone I talk to about politics isn't arguing for Kerry so much as they are arguing against Bush
Downtown - Montrose District(#454RJ) -= Jones and Clarke =-          Small shops line the streets, obviously an older part of the city, the initial settlings of Erin's Vale can be seen here
Some of them are reconstructed, new paint and wood being replaced on their structures, while others slowly decay from age
For the most part the small shops still manage to have a quaint appearance, allowing those that enjoy to pursue the history of the city to see some of it still evident
It was the introduction of a night club near the eastern side of the street however that caused some of the old fashioned store owners to cringe
It caters to those of more extreme and eccentric tastes, bringing a whole new variety of patrons to the area come night
It was the introduction of that club that opened the area to other less savory businesses
From time to time a patrol car can be seen, coming to look for those women of the night that are rumored to linger around the corner of the streets every so often
Obvious exits: Interzone Records IR  Daisy has arrived
Daisy walks into the record store
Daisy has left
Compton has arrived
You walk into the record store
Interzone Records - Main Room          Everything used to be something else, and Interzone Records used to be a bowling alley
Some traces of the original layout remain: the sunken floor, the shoe counters where the cash registers now sit, and most notably, the wide open spaces where the lanes once were, now filled with row after row of CD's and records, sorted by genre and artist
The walls are a testament to Erin's Vale's rich history as a stop on the Pacific Northwest touring circuit
They're covered from floor to ceiling in psychedelic-inspired posters, from cracked and fading Fleetwood Mac and Pink Floyd tours, to recently-printed memorabilia from The White Stripes and The Donnas
Just as the walls are covered in posters, so the counters and record bins are plastered with stickers, in some cases several layers deep, covering the history of punk rock, from The Ramones and Stiff Little Fingers, to bands that are still practicing in the garage
Near the counters, a small alcove has been devoted entirely to local bands, showcasing their music and littered with advertising fliers for local nightclubs, bars, music halls, and theaters - any place with a stage
Over the sound system, there is music playing
Always
*Places and +views available* Contents: Daisy Enid Obvious exits: Side Door    Out   Compton walks in off of the street
Compton has arrived
In a way, all used record stores have certain things in common
They're covered in posters
They're covered in band stickers
The Violent Femmes play on the sound system
There's a little punk girl with strangely-colored hair in the aisles, bopping along to the music while she returns CD's to their appropriate bins
They descend like plagues of locusts, Daisy and her ilk do, and don't let up until they've shoplifted or purchased every last goddamn copy of _ROCKET TO RUSSIA_
And so, locust-like, Daisy and her ilk decend, though today's ilk -- Compton and Penny -- suggest that she's a gutterpunk, rather than a high school punk
She wanders up and down the aisles, not purchasing anything in particular but, rather, maneuvering so as to allow Enid no possible line of sight that encompasses Penny, Compton, and herself
They're clever that way
Though the probable cameras render it entirely moot
Daisy and Penny walk in side by side, the former ahead of the later
Must've been her idea
So Penny tosses her cigarette outside while Compton's got the door
She follows Daisy down aisle ten, boots skidding on the unwaxed floor
She turns a shoulder to the stacks, flips through some cds in the dollar bin and yawns
'What're we supposed to be looking for?'  It's asked of Compton while she de-lints her pockets
The old guy, slips in last and quickly busies himself in the vynil section
'Judas Preist, the one they sued em' for in court
You know, like the actualy exhibit A one
'   One second he's at Blue Oyster Cult, then another on the opposite wall at the Dead section and then again at the Jimmy Bufett row
His presence is slippery, moving in and out of your attention like a lazy trout in your mind
It's not that he actually disapears, you just simply manage to miss him
Friends don't let friends shoplift The Ramones
Enid isn't looking, of course
She twists on the balls of her feet as if putting out a couple of cigarettes while she returns albums to their rightful place in Rock Music, A-M
She pops a great big bubble of pink gum and chews it loudly, though not so loudly that it can be heard over the music
P-dogg
'  P-dogg must refer to Penny, because it's in that directly that Daisy's facing, and it's in that direction that Penny's not responding
Maybe the music's too loud
She repeats:  'Dude
P-dogg
'  She's holding up a fine example of the contents of Aisle 10: a spoken word album whose album cover depicts William S
Burroughs' drooping features looking askance at an incogruous swirl of Technicolor
The album's title is so psychedelic as to be unreadable
'Did you get Hiro a Christmas present this year?'  Cornelius walks in off of the street
Cornelius has arrived
The record store is positively crowded
The Violent Femmes segue into The Velvet Underground, with Lou Reed singing 'Sweet Nothin'' in his cracked and ruined voice
Enid hum along, with great enthusiasm and little talent, when she's not popping her gum
Her hands are kept busy returning CD's to their bins
'Thought he was some kinda Buddhist
' Compton perks up from behind a crate of Steely Dan
The door to the music store swings open
A very wet old man bearing a strong resemblence to a drown cat steps inside the shop
it is cold out there
' Cornelius observes keenly
Momentarily dazed and confused by the visually blinding display of psychadelic 'art', he blinks his eyes, shaking his head
'My god
' Murmurs, turning immediately to a display
l Cornelius         This is an older man
Slight, sort of frail looking
Top of his head has a sort of dusty look to it
In truth it's just what remains of his white hair clinging to his bald head in light little whisps
Ice blue eyes are behind wire rimmed glasses
Skin is pale white, wrinkled, looks almost like paper
Cheeks are lightly tinted red, just a bit of color there
Nose is hooked, downwards and his lips are thin, set in a line of disapproval
Slender, scarecrow-like body appears to be loosely clad
The shirt is a plain blue dress shirt with a golden green tie that hangs down in front
The pants are light cotton dress pants, a black color, neatly pressed looking
Shoes are nice but kind of scuffy looking
Carries a cane in his left hand
Ebony with a silver cap in the shape of a smiling woman's head
'Yeah,' says Daisy, drowning out Lou Reed, 'he was some sort of Buddhist, on account of it having something to do with his Japanese ancestry, and then he pretty much dropped that in favor of something what I don't know what it is
'  Dextrous fingers busy themselves in the racks
It's apparent (now that she's attracting attention) that she's not shoplifting -- she's interweaving CDs from her purse with CDs on the rack
That's right, P-dogg isn't paying attention
Her fingers are tracing across an Anti-Flag section, staring intently at the back of the cd zoning out
'Daz-ee baby, slow down,' Daisy's getting much too far ahead of Penny 'there's totally no cameras here' catches her eye just then, implies there couldn't be 'it just wouldn't make economical sense
Surveillance in a bowling alley? Do you know how much space there really is here? I mean have you ever seen what goes on behind the pin machines? Me and this guy once, you remember Johnny Irish?'   A clear, shining example of the kind of person that hangs around in record stores
She's rocked, talking a mile a minute with no end in sight
'Well Johnny and I got into this thing one night after Jesse roped the wrong guy,
' Penny's still holding that cd at a strangely conversational angle 'like that guy? Daisy - like that guy,' pointing at Cornelius 'only black and he had kindof a gut
' How the guy in the story relates to the guy in the store is anyone's guess - it makes sense to Penny, so she continues 'Anyway so the point is we had to get outta the bar so we walked through an alley and ducked in this door, but like we had no idea where it went and it was the scariest
'  Enid is certainly an odd little creature
She returns a handfull of Misfits albums to their rightful place, then moves up the aisle for Leonard Cohen
Shobaz!' she calls out to the old man, once he's recovered from the former bowling alley's bright interior decorating scheme
'I wasn't sure you ever left your waxworks!' She glances sidelong at Daisy and waves Leoard Cohen's 'The Future' in a way that isn't the least bit threatening
'We've got a whole section over by the counter for local bands,' she says
'Or yu can just leave 'em at the counter and we'll sort 'em properly
'  'Hardly ever Nid, hardly ever
But I had some shopping to do
I recalled that you sold
records here
So I wanted to see what kind
' Looking around slowly, a wry smile touches his features
'Nothing that I would imagine that I would listen to
' Observing the others in the shop, he pauses looking at Daisy, as if he recognizes her before looking back to Enid
'Can you reccomend something?'  Laughter comes from Compton, now over at the 'C's and digging in to the Clash
Apparently the thought of local hillbillies mashing instruments being to Daisy's liking to be
unlikely
'Right
Well,' Daisy says, voice wavering sheepishly before it finds its strength
'We ain't exactly local, having just moved, as we did, from San Francisco and then to Toronto, and then after that to right here
I guess as I don't have to be sneaking them into the racks anymore
Hand goes in purse; hand comes up with gum; gum goes in mouth, then back again for a CD, which she tosses underhand in Enid's general direction
'Anyway
We're the Invisible College
Not to diss on my man Lou, but you could throw that on, if it happens that you want to
' She turns back to the racks
'I suppose I'll clean up your racks, then
'  Enid weaves out of Rock A-M, passing Compton at 'C,' where she makes approving noises of his taste in music, assuming that loud bubble gum popping sounds are approval
The cocks her head to the side as she attempts to read the old man
'Classical? Like, Verdi or Vivaldi or some other Italian guy? Wagner? Not that Wanger's Italian, but,' she gives a vague little wave of dismissal
'Jazz? Kletzmer? There's this band called the Kletzmatics that
you've gotta hear 'em
' She snatches Daisy's CD out of the air with her free hand
'Thanks,' she grins at the gutterpunk
'We'll make you a proper label and file you under Local and Rock I
You gus got any gigs yet, 'cus I've got a promoter friend who's breathin' down my neck for new acts
'  The older fellow ponders this for several moments
'I will try
ah, Kletz-matics
' Cornelius says, thoughtfully, glancing at the others before looking back to Nid
Rowdy kids
Probably going to try to jump him or something outside of the shop
Can't trust most young people
Degenerates, all of them! Penny moves around to where Daisy put down the Burroughs thing and picks it up then surprises everyone; see she WAS keeping up 'Christmas, huh
' An absent gesture, her hand goes inside her jacket with the cd
She looks down like there's something moving around her feet '
has it been a year already?'  Penny looks a little green
The smile on Daisy's face is so broad that it has to be put on crooked, half of it jammed up into the little cheek-room she has to spare and the other hanging relatively limply in the corner
It shows off some reasonably poor dentition and ill-considered dental hygeine, but that, if anything, is par for the course
'It's been a year for most of us, Penny dear,' says Daisy, eyes tracking Enid back toward the counter -- she IS going to put that album on
'I dunno how long it's been for you
' Enid sends Daisy's album flying across the counter, where it's caught by the red-haired punk working the register
In a few minute, it will be heard over the sound system, depending on what kind of priority the counter boy grants it
Now she waves Cornelius along towards the Folk section and looks around for the Kletzmatics
'They do this sort of funky Eastern European folk music, mostly in Yiddish, at least I think it's Yiddish,' she mutters
'It sounds kinda like coughing up a hairball
'  This gets a raspy chuckle
Cornelius walks over to the section she indicated
Fingers, like dexterous spider legs, click the records along before they slip one from the rack
He studies the front of it, then the back on it
Eyes always on those pesky kids
Daisy, sotto voce to Penny, eyes rolling as hard as they can: 'Euuch
'  Compton is old, to make a point
Well, much older than the 'kids' he trucks with
As he wanders the store, popping up here and there in his peculiar way it could be noted that he's older than the rock he checks out, older thena the Punk he puruses and older than the crap 60s Folk Music he avoids like the plauge
Each of the eras of music have washed over him like a ocean of Pop culture and yet he remains
Salty and crusty as any sea dog
Enid looks down at Cornelius in all of her blonde (at the roots, anyway) haired, blue-eyed goyish glory
'I think you'd like it
It's traditional, but it's not like they're all falling asleep while playing their accordions and squeezeboxes and stuff
Todd Ashley was totally listening to this when he started Firewater
' She looks expectantly at the much older gentlemen before her face falls and she says, 'Umm
forget I said that
It probably doesn't make any sense to you
'  'Indeed
It does not
' Cornelius grins, moving through the store to the front with the one record
Setting it on the counter, he asks
'How much for the purchase?'  Top priority, of course
What burst forth from the loudspeaker is not punk
It starts out breakbeat and noise
Noise and something spoken - it rises, tidal, and fades like the undertow - always there but just out of range to be heard
A silvery ting is flipped into the mix, shuddering with the vocal
It's not English
It's not Spanish or anything instantly recognizable - maybe Scandanavian - as a matter of fact it *does* sound a little like Bjork
But then again, maybe not
Penny ta-ta-tas with the bassline and touches Daisy's elbow and guides her, the beat nodding her head, toward Compton in a very pointed and specific way
Paranoid
The redheaded clerk at the counter puts on the album: it's always good to have one last-ditch local band to pull out in any musical discussion; something that no one else has ever heard of; something that stops the escalating erudition in its tracks
The music on the CD isn't what one would expect from Daisy
It's an intricate wash of pop culture -- here and there, you can pick out fragments of jingles from commericals of the 1980s, distorted quotes from old movies, soundtracks running both forward and backward
The vocals, cigarette-roughened and husky, aren't English
The vowel sounds are wrong, and rasping back-of-the throat noises -- as in Hebrew or Arabic -- predominate
Maybe the vocals are Daisy
It's hard to tell
In any case, she glides along with Penny, casting a sidelong (and not altogether comfortable) glance at Cornelius
Behind Compton, she stops, peeking out around for another look
Daisy says, 'Ignore the fact that Penny and I pretty much posed the same thing
I'd be damned if I was going to rewrite the whole thing just to avoid redundancy
'  The red-headed boy behind the counter rings up Cornelius' order
Enid lags behind, leaning against one of the bins with her head cocked to the side as the music starts
'Hmmmm
' Her chewing and popping slows to a near-halt
'Like Halou meets The Sugarcubes
You guys do this kinda thing live or are you strictly a science fair band?'  During the debut listening of the Colleges latest offering, COmpton appears next to Cornelius at he counter with an armfull of Carly Simon records and asks the red headed kid, 'Yo, where's the shitter?' in his completely accentless voice of slow death
The kid points to a partially blocked doorway in the back
Off Compton goes with a spyness in his step that wasn't there before
What? He doesn't like listening to Folk music
Blindly unaware of any of the interest in him, Cornelius takes out some wrinkled bills, putting them on the counter
Waiting for the boy to give him his change, he glances around the room one more time, observing
Curious
The red-haired boy makes change for Cornelius under Enid's watchful gaze
The yellow-haired girl rests a hand on her bony hip and glares at the counter boy as if to make sure he does it right
'You got time for me to come by the waxworks tomorrow night, Mr
Shobaz?' she asks
'I've got the night off
' It's a store full of music-lovers and gutterpunks and Nid wants to spend her free time with a guy old enough to be her grandfather
'Totally
Though they're, like, invitation-only, or did we stop doing that, Penny?'  Daisy leans back against the counter, rolling her shoulders in a sort of an approximation of a shrug
'We got sort of a vibe we're generally going for
And we usually only throw parties to premiere a new piece
Hiro comes up with them, mostly, and Jesse mixes
'  Penny looks dead-on at Cornelius; she's very clearly on something
It's an extreme stare - wide eyes and bitten lip
Because she thought it was an aside, Penny asides back 'We stopped until,' and she makes this hand gesture; a complicated riff on sign language
Daisy should translate for the curious
Penny looks greener
'It would be quite acceptable Nid
We can start with the basics
' Cornelius turns and meets Penny's gaze
Offers her a grin that might be friendly
But what are the chances of that
And it's gone
'See you tomorrow
I have procured the tools you will need
' Holding the CD, Cornelius makes his way for the door
To the lovely outside
It isn't ASL
It does, however, seem to remind Daisy
'We stopped until Monday turned to Saturday again
It's some kind of ritual inversion or sommat, right?, where maybe the public sphere becomes private and whatever?'  Grinning at Enid, not having bought anything yet, she makes for the door, Penny in tow
Penny probably doesn't realize it but the Burroughs cd is still in her hand
And as an anchor to Daisy, she can not help but be pulled by gravity in the direction she leads
Technically Compton should be leaving with them but he's
still in the bathroom
And who knows how long old men really take
Cornelius walks out of the record store and onto the street
Cornelius has left
Enid has disconnected
Mood:  Happy :)  Listening To:  Nothing, too late  Wow, wasted Monday and Tuesday
Dossed, played games, surfed, chatted
Had a good bitching session with craig tho
Really dislike Mark; have no real problem with Ben, but how he begs it from ben and paddy is sorta sad
Aidans grandad had a heart attack, hence the shortage of him
Jo was at Marks for 2 nights, hence her shortage
I'll be out to the cinema tomorrow, maybe with a review for the blog, who knows
Reason for happiness?
Pretty damn cute guy
Sweet, never been in a relationship before
Seems well decent, heh fallen in love (L) but yeah he's well cool and we'll prolly be meeting, w00t!  Short sweet post
I think I post more when depressed :/  PS:- Reading Dead Air by Iain Banks, pretty good so far, excellent Author
End Transmission
A long-time colleague of mine took his life Friday night
I'll return to writing the weblog in a couple days
Happy Fathers day Daddy O!!! i love you! heres a poem i wrote for my daddy today:) i printed it out on this paper that looks like a peice of 'natural wood' lol    Dad  Dad, you are the best
The best at rototilling ( which is like grinding up dirt for his garden lol) you are the best at mowing the lawn and also weed killing
You're the best at catering parties, the best at food cooking the greatest chef in the world and the best looking  you are the best at a lot of things things you love to do but the best thing i think you do is being the worlds best DUDE!(dad) lol   heres another poem i wrote today
its kinda dark   If  if flowers could bloom without pollen, sun or water would there be bumblees in sworms? if trains could run without engines,would their be tracks to cross
If people could respond to one another without whispering a word would people still love? if people would walk on glass without shoes would we bleed? if people could cry without sobbing  would their be tears to wipe away the sorrow and greif?  i love writing dark poems, thats just what i feel but my parents dont appreciate that
they tell me to stop writing poems about death and stuff
but u know what im not gonna writing poems like that helps me alot
oh well im going to bed now i think so goodnight    Love
So it is kind of like exiting one world and entering a new world
In the first world you are broke - but it is okay
It is okay because everyone in this world is broke except for the rare exceptions
Your time there is fun and you enjoy, not only the interaction, but hopefully the information learned
Then, like in birth, you squeeze your way out into the other world
In this world, you seek a career and money
Let's face it, you need these things
for in this world you are not interested in living on the street or going hungry
These two worlds are very common to all
Most, at one point or another, went through the small door and came to dwell in the new world
This is the time upon which one graduates from college and enters the world of business or whatever
Like a naked, starving baby hanging upside down being smacked on the but
I have entered this world
In the footsteps of those before me
I seek the confines of the new world through employment
Being in this stage is an adventure as my good friend Miss Julie would say
and I believe her
Yet, I can't help but think about the advantages of no longer being on this journey to find a job
It's sort of like a treasure hunt
and the more you look
the more in debt you become
In time, you hope to find the job that will fill the financial void of your adventure
May we all find the treasure
so that we may all enter the new world and quit being smacked on the butt like a newborn baby
Enjoy reader
Remember this story isn't based on actual events
Many of the situations discussed have NOT happened in real-life
also I speak only of the situation that plagues my friend's best friend's brother's cousin's girlfriend's nephew
So I hardly no the person at all
Twitched  tap tap tap the pencil taps in and out the people breathe ignorance bliss they dont believe over and over never learn God sends fire Evil burns flowing waters afloat lies me suffocating I feel free reaching for air crying in desperate despair walk away from troubled lives shot in the back and survived trapped in reality lost my sanity complete vanity Surrounds me Its my mentality searching hoping for new looking for the truth praying to God we trust sprinkled angel dust tap tap tap the pencil taps Like a bird in a cage Im always trapped
I didn't go to sleep until after 12:00 and I woke up at 1:45 am
I do not feel well so I am sitting at the computer surfing the net
I am mentally and physically exhausted but can't sleep since I do not feel well
I can't take any 'p
' Medication anymore because it has the opposite effect on me keeping me awake instead of allowing me to sleep
I feel pretty overwhelmed with the world right now
This is the week before Fashion Share so we all worked from 6:00-9:30 tonight making baskets, sorting dresses, etc
My mom is still in the hospital, I have a major graduate theater class next week (Authentic Assessment in the Arts), we leave on vacation the day after my class, we come home just a few days before school starts, my new classroom has nothing in it yet, and I am also finding my mind full of other stuff too
I am not understanding where I am with God right now
He has me at a point where I am trying to hear His voice, but I don't and I am not really feeling His presence right now
It is not a place I like being
I know He is with me
I have watched the healing in my mom begin (physically not spiritually yet) but there are some other areas in my life that just do not make sense
(kind of like my blog right now)  I am terrified of this coming school year
I am pursuing my  urlLink National Board Certification  in Theater and the work load for this program has me freaked out
I have to complete a portfolio that is HUGE (a few hundred pages) and take an essay style test that lasts for something like 4-6 hours
If I pass, I will be certified to teach theater anywhere in the U
and my state and district will pay me an extra stipend each year
It's worth it if I pass, and I am apparently the only person out here who has any fear of failure
I wish I had confidence in me the way that others do
Well it is VERY late
i think if I am going to stay up any longer, I need to pull out some of my National Board reading
Nothing like educational philosophy and standards to put you to sleep
Good night all

net >  Prepare to be mooned--blue mooned
This Saturday, July 31, a 'blue moon' rises
Of course, you probably won't see even a hint of blue color, just your average full moon
So what gives? What's so blue about a moon that isn't? Heck, astronomers even say that blue moons aren't rare
And folklorists say they're not what everyone thinks they are
As any budding astronomer can tell you, a 'blue moon' is the second full moon in a calendar month
It isn't really blue
It's just a name
But why, of all things, do we call a white moon 'blue' Actually, there are truly blue moons
In 1883, an Indonesian volcano erupted with the force of a 100-megaton nuclear bomb
With a roar heard nearly 400 miles (over 600 kilometers) away, Mount Krakatoa belched a column of volcanic gas and ash into the atmosphere
That night, the moon rose blue over Indonesia
Particles from Krakatoa's ash, not more than a micron wide, made it happen
These micron-wide particles were exactly the right size to scatter red light, while allowing other colors, such as blue, to pass
The result: a blue sphere hanging in the sky

In fact, for several years after the eruption, there were reports fro mall over the globe of red moons, green moons, and, yes, even more blue moons
What's more, some of the sunsets following the eruption were such a blazing red that people actually called on firemen to drown the optical illusion
The eruptions of Mount St
Helens and Mount Pinatubo produced the same anomaly
&nbsp; So have forest fires
&nbsp;Still, none of this explains why we call the second full moon in a month a blue moon
The phrase is old, even if the modern meaning is not
Before Shakespeare penned a word of Hamlet, the English knew little couplets like: If they say the moon is blewe, we must believe that it is true
Breakfast was yummy apple dippers from Mcdonalds! I love those things! Also have had a 24oz bottle of water so far this morning!
I had a very good night tonight with my dear friend Cisco
We didn't meet up till about 9 ish, which is usually really late for me but actually it worked out REALLY well today cause i was out helping my mom gardening and cutting down trees (thats right mother nature! i destroyed a shit load of trees!) and by the time i was done it was like 8:00 which is perfect timing cause i went inside had a superb shower and was on my way to meet Cisco
We went glow in the dark mini golfing (only thing to do in oakville) and then after that we just chilled out in my car, talking and stuff
i know it sounds super boring but i had a lot of fun:) hey come on! he had an accent! i could listen to him talk about shit and i would be happy to hear it all cause of his sexy accent
So we had an excellent night and everything went well
Tee hee he paid for mini golfing and i got spin an wheel and he got a damn free cookie and i got a damn cupon for 15% off golfing
So yeah i had a really good night, nothing went on
my mom never called my cell phone once cause well i earned the night away from yelling or screaming
OMG! MY MOM VACUMED THE HOUSE AND I'M NOT BEING YELLED AT WHEN I GOT HOME! tonight was an awsome night and i haven't had one of those in a while!  Considering i didn't get home till like 12:30am i didn't get yelled at or anything at all
my mom was in a happy mood so thats awsome
Well i'm on the phone with my sexy friend Chris and he needs someone to talk to  so i shall save my sexy man! ta ta people! Good night!

urlLink This story  from  urlLink CNN  describes a fairly mundane occurrence in the political world: Politician involved in sex scandal; politician finally admits sex scandal; politician resigns from various posts before being sacked
It happens all too frequently
What interests me is not the story itself but how it is written
If you read the first few paragraphs of the story the only way you could divine Goldschmidt's party affiliation is by inferring from the statement that he had been Transportation Secretary under Jimmy Carter that he is a Democrat
Let me reiterate that:  His party affiliation is never explicitly mentioned
Much is said by what is omitted
Update: 5/7/04: But quite apart from the subtle bias, CNN is capable of standing up and shooting their bias up like a flare, as in this  urlLink thoughtful, nuanced little story

I'm sorry for not posting yesterday, and I don't know if I did the day before or not
But my computer is being really screwy right now
I've run ScanDisk, Spybot, and defragmented it, and it seems to be performing SOMEWHAT more efficient, but it's still pissing me off
So we have decided to replace the ole klinker
Yes, that's right ladies and gentlemen, Matt is purchasing a new computer
Along with his younger brother, he's buying a Dell, with a SWEET video card that'll be able to take us through all the new games coming out
(Half-Life 2, Doom 3, etc
) It's gonna have an 80 gig hard-drive, and it's got a Pentium 4&nbsp; 3
0 Ghz processor
For those of you non-nerds out there, just disregard all the 'technical' terms being used here
Long story short, it is a NICE computer
It's gonna be pretty phat and I'm really excited about it
Tonight, I went to a softball game with Nicole, then went back to her house for a while and hung out with Ashley (Nicole's little sister), Heather (Nicole's older sister), Tyler (Heather's boyfriend/ex-boyfriend, no one really knows), and Miranda (god I hope that was her name, I'm bad with remembering names, but she's Heather and Tyler's friend)
We all hung out at the Griffetts Household and played uncomfortably childish games such as Duck-Duck-Goose and Uno
It was a really cool night, but me and Nicole didn't do anything physical besides hold hands in the car on the way back from the softball game
But that was part of why tonight was so awesome
We didn't  have  to do physical stuff to have fun tonight
We just
had fun! It's so great being up to like sit on the bridge with her or go see a movie with her, but it was just as awesome doing stupid crap like Duck-Duck-Goose and running around in a storm
Just being around her, being with her, it's so amazing
Just sitting there in the basement, my back against the wall, Tyler Heather Ashley and Miranda playing Uno, Nicole laying down with her eyes closed in front of me, and me just staring at Nicole and not being able to stop
I couldn't help myself
I was just thinking about how lucky I am to have a girl like her
So beautiful, so fucking gorgeous
And also so lucky to have such an  awesome  girl as mine
My look on this was that if she has the personality of an angel, and the body of an angel, what's she doin down here on Earth?  That's a new thing I've been thinking about
I was on the phone with Nicole tonight and I just kinda froze when this idea hit me and I didn't say anything for a minute or two
I think everyone on Earth feels the work of an angel at  some  time
Whether it's as personal as having them as their life partner, or just having someone--maybe even a complete stranger--do something great for you
And maybe
everyone is an angel
I really just don't know
We're all God's children, right? Aren't we  all  angels at  some  time? Think about it
Everyone has that ONE person that  totally  changes their life and shows them what they have to do, and shows them who they really are
Whether it's something small or big, everyone has that person
That person is like an angel, a messanger of God, delivering the message from the big man sayin something like 'hey, I still know you're there, I'm watchin over you still'
My depiction of God is just a normal guy
Someone who you can just be like 'hey' to
My God isn't this all-powerful, all-mighty omniscient being
he's just
A lot of this is told in one of my books, but there's a line in there where the main character is talking to God, and he says 'Do I have to follow you? Why do you force so many people to?' and God replies, 'I do not force people to follow me
The people who follow me
force people to follow me
'   I'm slipping back into something
God seems closer than he used to be
But I feel like I'm less in my 'I don't like God' stage to getting closer to him
Not like being a Christian, I don't think I'll ever be able to find myself in that stage again, but more like
accepting him
I don't know if I'm ready to start praying again
but for now, I'm alright with him bein there
He's a cool guy
And I hope in the future me and him can get closer
Not to the point where I can convert, but at least to where I'll be able to start praying again
You hear that, big guy? You're not such a bad dude after all

God, I love laying into these new-to-the-scene spring chickens
They've got so much to learn
I've stayed away much too long
I have been having these really sleepless nights lately and its freaking me out
I mean, its not like every day or anything but its at least once or twice a week I'm up until like 3 or 4am, not tired at all and cannot fall alseep
A friend came to say with me this weekend and I tired so hard to be quiet but I'm not so sure how successful that was
I told myself its because I haven't been journaling my thoughts like I should but I believe its much more than that
My mom and I were thinking it may have something to do with my summer lifestyle
Although I have been quite busy, at the end of the day I'm not as physically drained as I am during the school year so I can't fall asleep as easily
That may be it, but if so we'll see soon enough because school begins on Monday for me
Having said that
this is my last weekend of summer vacation and I need a GETAWAY
I was thinking about going to the G-unit as BB calls it to visit E
She wants to go up to Nikko Castle and waterfall in Tochigi-ken
I might check that out
See if we can hook up with any of the JETS AD in that area
Still undecided, but definitely going somewhere!!!  I hate backtrack blogging so I can't literally catch you all the way up on the events of the last 9 days but there are a few things that are certainly worth mentioning:  My SOCKS came today!!! I asked a friend of mine to send me some socks and Fruit by the Foot fruit snacks and they've arrived!!! YEAH!!! The box went to the BOE and they called me twice on my cell phone to let me know that a box had arrived
That made me totally happy
So here I sit, at 4pm on a Tuesday afternoon in my tshirt and panties and white Hanes socks eating fruit snacks
It truly is the little things!!!  My visit this weekend was totally amazing
I was surprised because I didn't really think that BB and I would have such a good time or enjoy each other so much, but we really did! It rained from when he arrived on Thursday until sometime during the day on Saturday
All of the fun outdoorsy stuff I had planned
cancelled
We had to go into town on Friday to get groceries and my VCR died so I needed to get a new one
That turned out to be a wild goose chase, but finally after spending about 4 hours looking for one, I finally found one
I was amazed at how difficult it is to buy just a VCR nowadays
Most things are sold as a DVD/VCR combo or just DVD
I guess I need to join the 21st Century
but I happen to like VHS
Well, anyway after that we got the groceries,  rented some movies, and came back here
We cooked dinner together (mostly him, I just did the salad and took the potato chips out of the grease) and watched TV, listened to music, drank and went to sleep
The next day was pretty much the same type of relaxing stuff, slept late, cooked breakfast, read, watched movies and then went out to the movies and for drinks
Its funny how you reall don't expect certain folks personalities to mesh well at all but his and mine do
Its good to have someone like him in my life right now that isn't as far away as RR is
What is it w/me and these same letter initialled people? Anyway, it will be interesting to see how things pan out
We won't see each other again for a while and we are sure to be around other people that know us both not just in our own little world like we were this weekend
Either way it works out, he's a cool guy so I hope the friendship remains
I got a new phone!!! Its real cute
And it has a camera on it although I didn't really want one with a camera
It doesn't really matter because its cute and I love it
Now I am going to try to see how I can get a moblog going as
queen T says
Today I pray:  for a restful nights sleep
Its already been a busy week and whatever it is that is keeping me awake at night, be it that I'm not talking with you enough Lord, or that I need to drink warm milk, help my spirit to be soothed enough to sleep well so that I have energy thru the day
James 1:2-3 says, 'Consider it pure joy my brothers whenever you face trials of many kinds, for you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverence
'  I always used to hate this verse
Mostly because I didn't know how to do that
To be happy when I'm going through something that tears me apart
And I mean truely happy
I could fake it and answer my friends' questions with 'I'm fine' or be sarcastic and pretend to be happy
neither of these I'm sure is what it means
Or what God wants us to do
Wants me to do
People say that God fills you with his love and it'll make you joyful
but is it wrong for me to say that it doesn't do that for me?  Maybe I'm not allowing for him to fill me with joy when I'm going through something hard
But the thing is
I don't know how to let God do that
Man, I need therapy or something
Sorry to inturrupt the conversation about plant names, but I just wanted to post at 12:59 AM in the morning
I just finished my big book report on  The White
(Good book)
Anyway, now Jeff can't yell at me for posting at boring times
Ugh, I have to get up in about four and a half hours!  Waaaah!  -An excruciatingly sleepy Rachel
Hopefuly this isn't what's gonna happen tomorrow:  Geometry Quiz (I have no idea what's going on) Chem Part I test (electrochemistry - again I have not idea what's going on)  Tuesday:  Physics test  Wednesday: Chem Part II test Chem project (I don't get how we're gonna present on the same day of our test)  Okay have I studied? No
I feel like a broken record, never do I change
I better get my act together before it's the day before the exam!
Eh, it was chuckler
I still have to give the majority of the brownies to the Brit, simply because he didn't pun it, he was just pissed
I have not written in my journal for about 6 days now
That is to long not to write
I am not going to move to California now
Well, he does not want to talk to me now because he has a guilty mind
That does not bother me
I understand
It is all because I am owned
I think I am working things out with my Man as well
We have allot of talking still to do
I think we need to open up more
I am trying on my end just getting Him to open up some
He is like a closed book, I think I have Him figure out and it changes
I trust Him allot with my feelings and everything
There are times I do stand up to Him
I have too
If I do not then I feel like He will walk all over me and I will not let that happen
I think sometimes He is pushing me to see if I will stand up to Him
We both test each other all the time
I got an email from my Man, I think this is so cute
I think He was jealous of someone else interested in me and wanted to own me
That tells me allot
I can say allot about my Man that allot will not approve of because of the lifestyle that we live in
You have to know about the lifestyle that we live in and understand it allot
He is hard on me, but then I do things so I can be punish by Him
This way I know that He cares about me
I hate disobeying Him but sometimes that is the only way I get any attention from Him
Before I go I got an weird phone call a little after midnight
I do not answer my phone if I do not have the number in it, so I let it go to voice mail and I could barely hear the person
I am going to do a search on the number
I could make out the word 'bitch' allot but not the other words I have to listen to it some more
Well, I better get my ass in bed now, I have a busy day before Saturday
is anybody traveling for thanksgiving?
Right, so
today starts with a Board meeting for the theatre where I volunteer
We are in the midst of reading scripts to choose the 01-02 season
As I am driving home (Noonish) I receive a phone call from Kelly saying that someone was trying to break into our garage
Apparently this MORON decided to try the break-in in midday with over 5 neighbors watching him
Don't worry
he didn't manage to bust his way into the (very empty) garage
He did manage to get himself caught by the police
However, because he didn't ACTUALLY break-in, they can't arrest him
And even though there were so many eyewitnesses, they don't have enough evidence
Whatever
Kelly and I are now quite paranoid
something that will rub off in a few days, I'm sure
On a happier note, I went back into the recording stuidio today to clean up a few tunes - and THAT went exceedingly well! Yay me
I'm not sure what my plans for this evening will be, but I'll let you know, eventually
So you won't lose it overnight?  Well, that may be the case for some, but I pretty much did gain my weight overnight
So I pretty much expect to lose the weight overnight
The weight gain was so fast that it left me clueless about my true state of obesity for many months
It hit me like a ton of bricks when I learned my true standing
Anyway, its Day 23 for me now
I believe this is officially the longest I've ever been on a diet
As of this morning,  I am down 26 pounds!  I gave up on the whole notion of not weighing for four months
Once you begin weighing, it is almost addictive! Each time I weigh, I'm fearful of there having been some sort of mistake with my weight the previous day
Anyway, gotta run!
I made a post this week, but obviously it didn't go through
haha oh well
Tonight - went to the soccer game at ND
Very fun! I realized that I am closer to my friends than I thought I was, and I'm really making more friends as well
It feels good to know that
Very good
not many people are on MSN
so I don't know what to say haha
It's only 1:30 AM
No school Monday! Yes! Spring Fever Reliever Week, thank God! Haha I am just not in a school mood! I am SO ready for summer! I'm listening to Rooney right now haha
very summery sounding
:-P  Well, guess that's it
Brett just signed on, so I'll talk to him! Hehe

Welcome to the blog of me, Kyle
I plan to post most of my 'soapbox' rants, comedy routines, and maybe an opinion or two on certain people
People who are viewing this probably don't know about most of those things, so I'll spell them out for you:  I love to rant about things I find wrong in the world
Things such as political correctness, religion, Anti-American shit, the ebonic culture, etc
Chances are, you'll be offended
I've taken about 3 or 4 gigs telling jokes at my sister's bar
I'd figure I'd most old and new comedy routines here to see how many people I either offend or how many people I make laugh
As for the opinion thing, these can range from Bush himself to a few 'acquintences' of mine
I'll just say what I think about them
You'll only be offended if you're the person who's ass I'm ripping a new hole open for
So anyway, I'll try to update daily
those who have read my rants in the past can expect to see all those reposted here soon
And remember: I fucking hate you all

Love Collage  I think I bought this vcd for quite some time already, but I didn't get a chance to watch it
Well, finally I watched it juz now
Love Collage is Ryoko Hirosue's latest movie also featuring Ryuhei Matsuda and Yukihiko Tsutsumi
It is all about  Makoto (Ryuhei) n his 'Mysterious' lover Shizuru (Ryoko)
They break up bcos of a silly reason
One day, Makoto received a letter from Shizuru, attached with some collages
At the same time, he get to know that Shizuru was murdered in New  York
So, he left for NY to find out
the funny part is when Makoto speaks English
if there is no subtitle provided, I really dunno what was he talking about
i didn't get it
the pronunciation is damn NICE!!! Yet again, Ryoko is so so so so cute
hehehe
well this movie is directed by the director who directed  the Jap pop series --- Good Luck
Sorry about the stupid title
Too lazy to think of a good one
Merry Christmas Eve everyone
hopefully you will have a completely uneventful Christmas
:D   I guess I don't have as much to say as I thought
Oh well
Oh, and, Marten, I already do see a psychologist

urlLink The nation state  is a website that allows you to setup your own nation and dictate its laws and politics
If you choose to you can become a power wielding dictator oppressing your people with a police state and high taxes or run a benevolent republic ensuring that all your denizens have a Utopian life style , the choice is yours
The idea came from Max Barry, the author of  Jennifer Government
When setting up your nation state you can choose the type of government, the name, (but this may take some time to find one that has not already been taken) design your own flag, choose currency and national animal
Each day you are presented with 1 issue that your government needs to address, this can be changed to two if like me you feel the need to have more daily input
Your not alone!, to ensure that at least some of the nation states adhere to international law the game includes a virtual  Nations'>UN
This Virtual Organisation holds debates and sets laws on issues from Human Rights to correct spelling, all of which must be adhered to if you wish the join the  Nations'>UN , but not all do
As an alternative to the UN you can join or indeed set up a coalition with other nation states
Overall it's a clever idea that is possibly no more than a quick diversion from work, But for Max Barry it a clever way to advertise your new book
Have a look at my nation state  urlLink here

Well, been absent for two school days
Loads of catching up to do
Physics
Ms So seems to have to revise all topics with the class on request by us
So I guess time spent on each chapter wont be a lot and I'll have to do my own revision before she does it with the class so that I can ask questions
A math, I'm lagging behind
Gotta catch up
Everyone's at chapter 6 while I cant figure out chapter 5 yet
Oh well, gotta see how it goes tomorrow
So I guess I cant do much of revision today yet
Just have to do math and read through Germany
Slept too much this afternoon
Gotta make up of the lost time adious
HOLLA bitches!  So how was everyone's Easter?  Mine was great, glad you asked
Anyway, I went to New Orleans for Easter
saw my dad, Maria, the triplets
It was awesome
I haven't seen them in forever, and I love my little brothers and sister
They are hilarious
We drove to Diamondhead, Mississippi to go to my grandmother's house Easter Sunday
that was kinda cool
When we were there, Anthony called Gus a 'son of a bitch' and said 'shit
'  They're three
I love those kids
Plus, Maria and Dad bought me clothes for David's (as in my brother's) wedding
Apparently everyone on my dad's side of the family was kinda taken aback that Laura (brother's fiancee) didn't ask me to be a bridesmaid b/c that's a southern custom to ask the groom's sister(s) to be bridesmaids
I don't think that's really a custom in Texas
Texas is a different kind of South than the rest of the South
But I'm not offended or anything b/c who cares and Laura is the sweetest girl ever and wouldn't do anything malicious
Besides it's her wedding she can do whatever she wants
So yeah just kinda got off on a tangent there but yeah I had a wonderful Easter
Ok I gotta go b/c Oprah's on and it's about being on the 'down low'
you know, black men who are basically bisexual
as in they have girlfriends/wives but secretly have sex with men
Just kidding
Suzy I'll work on showing you my latest pieces
I don't really know how to do that
Heather can you help me??
